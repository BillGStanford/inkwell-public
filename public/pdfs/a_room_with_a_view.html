<p>PART ONE</p>
<p>Chapter I</p>
<p>The Bertolini</p>
<p>“The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no</p>
<p>business at all. She promised us south rooms with a view close</p>
<p>together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a</p>
<p>courtyard, and a long way apart. Oh, Lucy!”</p>
<p>“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by</p>
<p>the Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at</p>
<p>the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the</p>
<p>row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between</p>
<p>the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late</p>
<p>Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at</p>
<p>the notice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.),</p>
<p>that was the only other decoration of the wall. “Charlotte, don’t you</p>
<p>feel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all</p>
<p>kinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s being so</p>
<p>tired.”</p>
<p>“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying</p>
<p>down her fork.</p>
<p>“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her</p>
<p>letter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to</p>
<p>do it at all. Oh, it is a shame!”</p>
<p>“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard</p>
<p>that you shouldn’t have a view.”</p>
<p>Lucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me:</p>
<p>of course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first</p>
<p>vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part</p>
<p>of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of</p>
<p>generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.</p>
<p>“No, no. You must have it.”</p>
<p>“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”</p>
<p>“She would never forgive _me_.”</p>
<p>The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a</p>
<p>little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness</p>
<p>they wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one</p>
<p>of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant</p>
<p>forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>“I have a view, I have a view.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them</p>
<p>over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that</p>
<p>they would “do” till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was</p>
<p>ill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy</p>
<p>build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something</p>
<p>childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.</p>
<p>What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her</p>
<p>glance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was</p>
<p>probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the</p>
<p>swim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then</p>
<p>said: “A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”</p>
<p>“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view</p>
<p>too.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.</p>
<p>“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll</p>
<p>have yours. We’ll change.”</p>
<p>The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with</p>
<p>the new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as</p>
<p>possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the</p>
<p>question.”</p>
<p>“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.</p>
<p>“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”</p>
<p>“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again</p>
<p>repressed her.</p>
<p>“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And</p>
<p>he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,</p>
<p>saying, “George, persuade them!”</p>
<p>“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s</p>
<p>nothing else to say.”</p>
<p>He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed</p>
<p>and sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in</p>
<p>for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that</p>
<p>whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened</p>
<p>till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something</p>
<p>quite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the</p>
<p>old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not</p>
<p>change? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half</p>
<p>an hour.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was</p>
<p>powerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any</p>
<p>one so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as</p>
<p>much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who</p>
<p>were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs</p>
<p>of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are</p>
<p>genteel.”</p>
<p>“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with</p>
<p>the meat that she had once censured.</p>
<p>Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.</p>
<p>“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will</p>
<p>make a change.”</p>
<p>Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The</p>
<p>curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout</p>
<p>but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,</p>
<p>cheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired</p>
<p>decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,</p>
<p>however bad the rooms are. Oh!”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:</p>
<p>“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you</p>
<p>helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”</p>
<p>The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember</p>
<p>the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward</p>
<p>pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by</p>
<p>Lucy.</p>
<p>“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of</p>
<p>spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her</p>
<p>cousin had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer</p>
<p>Street, too, makes it so specially funny.”</p>
<p>“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the</p>
<p>course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—”</p>
<p>“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you</p>
<p>at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe</p>
<p>is—’”</p>
<p>“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer</p>
<p>Street next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming</p>
<p>neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe</p>
<p>bowed.</p>
<p>“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not</p>
<p>often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”</p>
<p>“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”</p>
<p>He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than</p>
<p>to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the</p>
<p>girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length</p>
<p>that she had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a</p>
<p>newcomer, and he was first in the field. “Don’t neglect the country</p>
<p>round,” his advice concluded. “The first fine afternoon drive up to</p>
<p>Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.”</p>
<p>“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are</p>
<p>wrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”</p>
<p>“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We</p>
<p>are in luck.”</p>
<p>And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People</p>
<p>told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams,</p>
<p>how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter,</p>
<p>how much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had</p>
<p>decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way</p>
<p>they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose</p>
<p>the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They must go to Prato.</p>
<p>That place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in</p>
<p>shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”</p>
<p>The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then</p>
<p>returned moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do.</p>
<p>Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave</p>
<p>her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when</p>
<p>she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous</p>
<p>little bow.</p>
<p>The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,</p>
<p>but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the</p>
<p>curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with</p>
<p>more than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing</p>
<p>good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy,</p>
<p>and Victorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this</p>
<p>attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.</p>
<p>And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival</p>
<p>the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really</p>
<p>Italy?</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which</p>
<p>had the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and</p>
<p>forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some</p>
<p>invisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to you,” she was saying. “The</p>
<p>first evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a</p>
<p>peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.”</p>
<p>He expressed his regret.</p>
<p>“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us</p>
<p>at dinner?”</p>
<p>“Emerson.”</p>
<p>“Is he a friend of yours?”</p>
<p>“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”</p>
<p>“Then I will say no more.”</p>
<p>He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.</p>
<p>“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin,</p>
<p>Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation</p>
<p>to people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.</p>
<p>I hope I acted for the best.”</p>
<p>“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a</p>
<p>few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have</p>
<p>come of accepting.”</p>
<p>“No _harm_, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”</p>
<p>“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said</p>
<p>gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor</p>
<p>expect you to show gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying</p>
<p>exactly what he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks</p>
<p>you would value them. He no more thought of putting you under an</p>
<p>obligation than he thought of being polite. It is so difficult—at</p>
<p>least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.”</p>
<p>Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so</p>
<p>always hope that people will be nice.”</p>
<p>“I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every</p>
<p>point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will</p>
<p>differ. But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When</p>
<p>he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no</p>
<p>tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he</p>
<p>will not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him</p>
<p>to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of</p>
<p>it.”</p>
<p>“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching</p>
<p>of the lips.</p>
<p>“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”</p>
<p>“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a</p>
<p>nice creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his</p>
<p>father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a</p>
<p>Socialist.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have</p>
<p>accepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and</p>
<p>suspicious?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”</p>
<p>“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent</p>
<p>rudeness?”</p>
<p>He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,</p>
<p>and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.</p>
<p>“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why</p>
<p>didn’t you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I</p>
<p>haven’t monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as</p>
<p>well as all dinner-time.”</p>
<p>“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see</p>
<p>good in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”</p>
<p>“My dear Lucia—”</p>
<p>“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally</p>
<p>laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”</p>
<p>“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will</p>
<p>approve of Mr. Beebe.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”</p>
<p>“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable</p>
<p>world. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind</p>
<p>the times.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Lucy despondently.</p>
<p>There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval</p>
<p>was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy</p>
<p>Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not</p>
<p>determine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am</p>
<p>afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.”</p>
<p>And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must</p>
<p>be more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”</p>
<p>Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been</p>
<p>smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed</p>
<p>to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to</p>
<p>chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the</p>
<p>gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s</p>
<p>health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of</p>
<p>thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her</p>
<p>subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention</p>
<p>than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was</p>
<p>proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real</p>
<p>catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when</p>
<p>she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea,</p>
<p>though one better than something else.</p>
<p>“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so</p>
<p>English.”</p>
<p>“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson</p>
<p>was more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”</p>
<p>“I think he was meaning to be kind.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of</p>
<p>course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could</p>
<p>not be too careful with a young girl.</p>
<p>Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No</p>
<p>one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not</p>
<p>noticed it.</p>
<p>“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have</p>
<p>you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most</p>
<p>indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?”</p>
<p>“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty</p>
<p>and delicacy the same?”</p>
<p>“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are</p>
<p>so difficult, I sometimes think.”</p>
<p>She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking</p>
<p>extremely pleasant.</p>
<p>“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so</p>
<p>glad. Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing</p>
<p>what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me</p>
<p>come and ask you. He would be so pleased.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.</p>
<p>The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was silent.</p>
<p>“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I</p>
<p>must apologize for my interference.”</p>
<p>Gravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett</p>
<p>reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with</p>
<p>yours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at</p>
<p>Florence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to</p>
<p>turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and</p>
<p>then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?”</p>
<p>She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the</p>
<p>drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The</p>
<p>clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with</p>
<p>her message.</p>
<p>“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the</p>
<p>acceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”</p>
<p>The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the</p>
<p>floor, so low were their chairs.</p>
<p>“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him</p>
<p>personally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to</p>
<p>him as soon as he comes out.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came</p>
<p>forth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to</p>
<p>the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.</p>
<p>“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.</p>
<p>“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do</p>
<p>to keep polite.”</p>
<p>“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then</p>
<p>looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own</p>
<p>rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the</p>
<p>winds of heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not</p>
<p>realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand</p>
<p>and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly</p>
<p>realize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was</p>
<p>reduced to literature. Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy,</p>
<p>she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.</p>
<p>For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the</p>
<p>half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a</p>
<p>sigh, and said:</p>
<p>“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will</p>
<p>superintend the move.”</p>
<p>“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.</p>
<p>“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”</p>
<p>“But I would like to help you.”</p>
<p>“No, dear.”</p>
<p>Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her</p>
<p>life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So</p>
<p>Lucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in</p>
<p>her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less</p>
<p>delicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room</p>
<p>without any feeling of joy.</p>
<p>“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken</p>
<p>the largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;</p>
<p>but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure</p>
<p>your mother would not like it.”</p>
<p>Lucy was bewildered.</p>
<p>“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under</p>
<p>an obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in</p>
<p>my small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a</p>
<p>guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”</p>
<p>“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of</p>
<p>larger and unsuspected issues.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as</p>
<p>she wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and</p>
<p>when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the</p>
<p>clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to</p>
<p>see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato,</p>
<p>and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the</p>
<p>door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards</p>
<p>led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was</p>
<p>then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on</p>
<p>which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.</p>
<p>“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the</p>
<p>light of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,</p>
<p>obnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to</p>
<p>destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,</p>
<p>since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it</p>
<p>carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it</p>
<p>clean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed</p>
<p>heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.</p>
<p>Chapter II</p>
<p>In Santa Croce with No Baedeker</p>
<p>It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright</p>
<p>bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are</p>
<p>not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini</p>
<p>sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too,</p>
<p>to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar</p>
<p>fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees</p>
<p>and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling</p>
<p>against the embankment of the road.</p>
<p>Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy</p>
<p>foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for</p>
<p>some mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the</p>
<p>window. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms</p>
<p>were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried</p>
<p>to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their</p>
<p>faces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking,</p>
<p>undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a</p>
<p>great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them</p>
<p>walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went</p>
<p>little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar</p>
<p>became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a</p>
<p>caterpillar in a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and</p>
<p>some white bullocks came out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been</p>
<p>for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the</p>
<p>road might never have got clear.</p>
<p>Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and</p>
<p>the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of</p>
<p>Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing</p>
<p>but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as</p>
<p>well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on</p>
<p>Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window</p>
<p>before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the</p>
<p>best of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin</p>
<p>had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the</p>
<p>crumbs.</p>
<p>A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was,</p>
<p>after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the</p>
<p>morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy</p>
<p>would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but,</p>
<p>of course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of</p>
<p>course she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy</p>
<p>would stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!</p>
<p>At this point the clever lady broke in.</p>
<p>“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you</p>
<p>can neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be</p>
<p>perfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa</p>
<p>Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to</p>
<p>school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one</p>
<p>takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained</p>
<p>tightly behind.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s</p>
<p>daughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being</p>
<p>so very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a</p>
<p>long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be</p>
<p>delighted.</p>
<p>“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you</p>
<p>bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”</p>
<p>Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to</p>
<p>see where Santa Croce was.</p>
<p>“Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from</p>
<p>Baedeker. He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true</p>
<p>Italy—he does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found</p>
<p>by patient observation.”</p>
<p>This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and</p>
<p>started with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.</p>
<p>The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.</p>
<p>Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right</p>
<p>along the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the</p>
<p>side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle</p>
<p>Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San</p>
<p>Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a</p>
<p>murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the</p>
<p>river were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then</p>
<p>Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she</p>
<p>stopped, and she cried:</p>
<p>“A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has</p>
<p>its own smell.”</p>
<p>“Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother</p>
<p>a distaste to dirt.</p>
<p>“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes</p>
<p>for life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at</p>
<p>that adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple</p>
<p>soul!”</p>
<p>So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,</p>
<p>short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s</p>
<p>grace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so</p>
<p>cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,</p>
<p>only increased the sense of festivity.</p>
<p>“Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never</p>
<p>repent of a little civility to your inferiors. _That_ is the true</p>
<p>democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re</p>
<p>shocked.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out.</p>
<p>My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful</p>
<p>about Ireland.”</p>
<p>“I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical</p>
<p>again now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our</p>
<p>front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the</p>
<p>Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.”</p>
<p>“Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over</p>
<p>the Weald.”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.</p>
<p>“What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very</p>
<p>nicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there</p>
<p>was?”</p>
<p>“Very well indeed.”</p>
<p>“And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”</p>
<p>“Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you</p>
<p>have property in Surrey?”</p>
<p>“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty</p>
<p>acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her</p>
<p>aunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last</p>
<p>name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street</p>
<p>the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And</p>
<p>just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”</p>
<p>Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the</p>
<p>tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But</p>
<p>Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that</p>
<p>Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.</p>
<p>“Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have</p>
<p>taken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!</p>
<p>What are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is</p>
<p>what _I_ call an adventure.”</p>
<p>Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,</p>
<p>that they should ask the way there.</p>
<p>“Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, _not_</p>
<p>to look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it. We</p>
<p>will simply drift.”</p>
<p>Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,</p>
<p>neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the</p>
<p>city abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa,</p>
<p>and became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy</p>
<p>appeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the</p>
<p>living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can</p>
<p>ever stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from</p>
<p>the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against</p>
<p>circlets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything more</p>
<p>beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her</p>
<p>forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a</p>
<p>mile.</p>
<p>The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or</p>
<p>rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste</p>
<p>out of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly of</p>
<p>the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the</p>
<p>great unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,</p>
<p>large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white</p>
<p>façade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It</p>
<p>was Santa Croce. The adventure was over.</p>
<p>“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to</p>
<p>them. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into</p>
<p>the church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!”</p>
<p>“We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their</p>
<p>rooms. They were so very kind.”</p>
<p>“Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my</p>
<p>Italy like a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to</p>
<p>set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who</p>
<p>couldn’t pass it.”</p>
<p>“What would you ask us?”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest</p>
<p>that she, at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood</p>
<p>they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it</p>
<p>when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:</p>
<p>“There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”</p>
<p>And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak</p>
<p>flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an</p>
<p>old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.</p>
<p>Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The</p>
<p>beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that</p>
<p>a young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly</p>
<p>into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was</p>
<p>really almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her</p>
<p>local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both</p>
<p>gesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly</p>
<p>because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her</p>
<p>Baedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way</p>
<p>about in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never</p>
<p>be in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,</p>
<p>talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was</p>
<p>full of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and</p>
<p>humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the</p>
<p>Franciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful</p>
<p>building. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it</p>
<p>contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values</p>
<p>she was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her</p>
<p>which they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be</p>
<p>enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was</p>
<p>no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved</p>
<p>the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one</p>
<p>that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.</p>
<p>Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of</p>
<p>acquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the</p>
<p>Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into</p>
<p>the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and</p>
<p>out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,</p>
<p>not to spit. She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their</p>
<p>Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that</p>
<p>overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their</p>
<p>career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to</p>
<p>the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it</p>
<p>very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with</p>
<p>their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then</p>
<p>retreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy</p>
<p>realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to</p>
<p>acquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby</p>
<p>stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr.</p>
<p>Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.</p>
<p>Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell</p>
<p>heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.</p>
<p>“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had</p>
<p>darted forward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the</p>
<p>sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where</p>
<p>you ought to be. Intolerable bishop!”</p>
<p>The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful</p>
<p>people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him</p>
<p>not to be superstitious.</p>
<p>“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,</p>
<p>cold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”</p>
<p>The child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.</p>
<p>Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an</p>
<p>Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the</p>
<p>rescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she</p>
<p>stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his</p>
<p>knees. He stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.</p>
<p>“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than</p>
<p>all the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe</p>
<p>in those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of</p>
<p>the universe—”</p>
<p>He paused for a phrase.</p>
<p>“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.</p>
<p>In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was</p>
<p>determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and,</p>
<p>if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious</p>
<p>reference to the pleasant rooms.</p>
<p>“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what</p>
<p>are you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the</p>
<p>church?”</p>
<p>“No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss</p>
<p>Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too</p>
<p>bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come</p>
<p>in by myself.”</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.</p>
<p>“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the</p>
<p>young lady for the first time.</p>
<p>“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”</p>
<p>“Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded. It’s</p>
<p>worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker. _That’s_ worth minding.”</p>
<p>Lucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not</p>
<p>sure whither it would lead her.</p>
<p>“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this</p>
<p>where the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not</p>
<p>suppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the</p>
<p>child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.</p>
<p>I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.”</p>
<p>“My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating</p>
<p>what you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy;</p>
<p>but you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead</p>
<p>what part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a</p>
<p>real pleasure.”</p>
<p>Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been</p>
<p>furious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is</p>
<p>difficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.</p>
<p>Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the</p>
<p>other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to</p>
<p>be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him. It was</p>
<p>at him that she gazed before replying.</p>
<p>“I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you</p>
<p>will kindly tell me which they are.”</p>
<p>The son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to</p>
<p>the Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt</p>
<p>like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.</p>
<p>The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of</p>
<p>them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship</p>
<p>Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.</p>
<p>“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce;</p>
<p>how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before</p>
<p>any taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these</p>
<p>frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the</p>
<p>snares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic,</p>
<p>more pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge</p>
<p>and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!”</p>
<p>“No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.</p>
<p>“Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means</p>
<p>the workmen weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no</p>
<p>truth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I</p>
<p>do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.”</p>
<p>He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside,</p>
<p>the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted</p>
<p>uneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with</p>
<p>these men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and</p>
<p>so strange that she could not remember how to behave.</p>
<p>“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”</p>
<p>George replied:</p>
<p>“It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to</p>
<p>heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should</p>
<p>like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”</p>
<p>“You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will lie</p>
<p>at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as</p>
<p>surely as our work survives.”</p>
<p>“Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint,</p>
<p>whoever he is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at</p>
<p>all.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two</p>
<p>parties. We will incommode you no longer.”</p>
<p>The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,</p>
<p>for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They</p>
<p>filed out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little</p>
<p>old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine</p>
<p>Alan.</p>
<p>“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”</p>
<p>The procession disappeared without a word.</p>
<p>Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the</p>
<p>life of St. Francis.</p>
<p>“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”</p>
<p>George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I</p>
<p>don’t remember.”</p>
<p>“Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It’s that Mr.</p>
<p>Eager. Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go</p>
<p>and say we are sorry. Hadn’t I better? Then perhaps he will come back.”</p>
<p>“He will not come back,” said George.</p>
<p>But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the</p>
<p>Rev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear</p>
<p>the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old</p>
<p>man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every</p>
<p>little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.</p>
<p>“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He</p>
<p>will try to be kind.”</p>
<p>“I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.</p>
<p>“Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people</p>
<p>because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or</p>
<p>frightened.”</p>
<p>“How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I</p>
<p>think that a kind action done tactfully—”</p>
<p>“Tact!”</p>
<p>He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong</p>
<p>answer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.</p>
<p>For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon</p>
<p>it—hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again</p>
<p>at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of</p>
<p>acorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,</p>
<p>of tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon</p>
<p>passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born</p>
<p>of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,</p>
<p>and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone</p>
<p>familiar to her.</p>
<p>“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.</p>
<p>“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They</p>
<p>won’t come back.”</p>
<p>“...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in</p>
<p>others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on</p>
<p>St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.</p>
<p>“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at</p>
<p>those saints?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Lucy. “They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone</p>
<p>that is praised in Ruskin?”</p>
<p>He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.</p>
<p>George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man</p>
<p>wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a</p>
<p>barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were</p>
<p>also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old</p>
<p>lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his</p>
<p>Mass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half</p>
<p>interested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had</p>
<p>impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.</p>
<p>“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in</p>
<p>it.”</p>
<p>“I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about</p>
<p>his tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies</p>
<p>better.”</p>
<p>“So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby’s worth the</p>
<p>whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”</p>
<p>Lucy again felt that this did not do.</p>
<p>“In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear!” said Lucy.</p>
<p>“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one to</p>
<p>give him? And think how he has been brought up—free from all the</p>
<p>superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the</p>
<p>name of God. With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to</p>
<p>grow up happy.”</p>
<p>She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old</p>
<p>man, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother</p>
<p>might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte</p>
<p>would object most strongly.</p>
<p>“What are we to do with him?” he asked. “He comes out for his holiday</p>
<p>to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to</p>
<p>have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What</p>
<p>did you say?”</p>
<p>Lucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:</p>
<p>“Now don’t be stupid over this. I don’t require you to fall in love</p>
<p>with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him. You are</p>
<p>nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.</p>
<p>You might help me. He has known so few women, and you have the time.</p>
<p>You stop here several weeks, I suppose? But let yourself go. You are</p>
<p>inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night. Let yourself</p>
<p>go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,</p>
<p>and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By</p>
<p>understanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will be</p>
<p>good for both of you.”</p>
<p>To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.</p>
<p>“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.”</p>
<p>“And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.</p>
<p>“The old trouble; things won’t fit.”</p>
<p>“What things?”</p>
<p>“The things of the universe. It is quite true. They don’t.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?”</p>
<p>In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting</p>
<p>poetry, he said:</p>
<p>“‘From far, from eve and morning,</p>
<p>And yon twelve-winded sky,</p>
<p>The stuff of life to knit me</p>
<p>Blew hither: here am I’</p>
<p>George and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that</p>
<p>we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life</p>
<p>is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But</p>
<p>why should this make us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and</p>
<p>work and rejoice. I don’t believe in this world sorrow.”</p>
<p>Miss Honeychurch assented.</p>
<p>“Then make my boy think like us. Make him realize that by the side of</p>
<p>the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a</p>
<p>Yes.”</p>
<p>Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy</p>
<p>because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind,</p>
<p>or a Yes, or something!</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry,” she cried. “You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then</p>
<p>she became matronly. “Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he no</p>
<p>particular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally</p>
<p>forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for</p>
<p>my brother. Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the</p>
<p>Lakes.”</p>
<p>The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.</p>
<p>This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him</p>
<p>and that he was thanking her for it. Indeed, he no longer alarmed her</p>
<p>at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her feelings</p>
<p>were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically,</p>
<p>before she lost Baedeker. The dear George, now striding towards them</p>
<p>over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. He approached,</p>
<p>his face in the shadow. He said:</p>
<p>“Miss Bartlett.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing</p>
<p>the whole of life in a new perspective. “Where? Where?”</p>
<p>“In the nave.”</p>
<p>“I see. Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked</p>
<p>herself.</p>
<p>“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson. “Poor girl!”</p>
<p>She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling</p>
<p>herself.</p>
<p>“Poor girl? I fail to understand the point of that remark. I think</p>
<p>myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you. I’m thoroughly happy, and</p>
<p>having a splendid time. Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.</p>
<p>There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to</p>
<p>invent it. Good-bye. Thank you both so much for all your kindness. Ah,</p>
<p>yes! there does come my cousin. A delightful morning! Santa Croce is a</p>
<p>wonderful church.”</p>
<p>She joined her cousin.</p>
<p>Chapter III</p>
<p>Music, Violets, and the Letter “S”</p>
<p>It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered</p>
<p>a more solid world when she opened the piano. She was then no longer</p>
<p>either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.</p>
<p>The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept</p>
<p>those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The</p>
<p>commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without</p>
<p>effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and</p>
<p>thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate</p>
<p>his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.</p>
<p>Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom. Lucy</p>
<p>had done so never.</p>
<p>She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings</p>
<p>of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one</p>
<p>of her age and situation. Nor was she the passionate young lady, who</p>
<p>performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.</p>
<p>Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped</p>
<p>between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the</p>
<p>pictorial style. And she was tragical only in the sense that she was</p>
<p>great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory. Victory of what</p>
<p>and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.</p>
<p>But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can</p>
<p>gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and</p>
<p>Lucy had decided that they should triumph.</p>
<p>A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she</p>
<p>really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. A few</p>
<p>people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she</p>
<p>made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to</p>
<p>sleep. She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for</p>
<p>her cigarette-case. Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by</p>
<p>the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by</p>
<p>touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical</p>
<p>element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge</p>
<p>Wells when he had discovered it. It was at one of those entertainments</p>
<p>where the upper classes entertain the lower. The seats were filled with</p>
<p>a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish,</p>
<p>under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the</p>
<p>drawing of a champagne cork. Among the promised items was “Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch. Piano. Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it</p>
<p>would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his</p>
<p>composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III. He was in</p>
<p>suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens</p>
<p>does one know what the performer intends. With the roar of the opening</p>
<p>theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords</p>
<p>that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory. He</p>
<p>was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have</p>
<p>paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of</p>
<p>nine-sixteen. The audience clapped, no less respectful. It was Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.</p>
<p>“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.</p>
<p>“Cousin of one of my parishioners. I do not consider her choice of a</p>
<p>piece happy. Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal</p>
<p>that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if</p>
<p>anything, disturbs.”</p>
<p>“Introduce me.”</p>
<p>“She will be delighted. She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises</p>
<p>of your sermon.”</p>
<p>“My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe. “Why ever did she listen to it?”</p>
<p>When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch,</p>
<p>disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity</p>
<p>of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. She loved going</p>
<p>to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee</p>
<p>and meringues. He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. But</p>
<p>before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he</p>
<p>now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved</p>
<p>dreamily towards him:</p>
<p>“If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very</p>
<p>exciting both for us and for her.”</p>
<p>Lucy at once re-entered daily life.</p>
<p>“Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she</p>
<p>said she trusted I should never live a duet.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t mind it. But she doesn’t like one to get excited over</p>
<p>anything; she thinks I am silly about it. She thinks—I can’t make out.</p>
<p>Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any</p>
<p>one’s. She has never got over it. Of course, I didn’t mean that I</p>
<p>played well; I only meant—”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.</p>
<p>“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She could not</p>
<p>complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole</p>
<p>life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in</p>
<p>Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.</p>
<p>The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,</p>
<p>and the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were</p>
<p>concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon</p>
<p>to visit the Torre del Gallo.</p>
<p>“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.</p>
<p>“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.</p>
<p>The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,</p>
<p>tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and</p>
<p>a tickling cough in her throat. On another day, when the whole world</p>
<p>was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse</p>
<p>to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no</p>
<p>fit companion for a hearty girl.</p>
<p>“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She hopes to find the true</p>
<p>Italy in the wet I believe.”</p>
<p>“Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,</p>
<p>the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of</p>
<p>definition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but</p>
<p>they would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for</p>
<p>other reasons, he held his peace.</p>
<p>“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is</p>
<p>writing a book?”</p>
<p>“They do say so.”</p>
<p>“What is it about?”</p>
<p>“It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.</p>
<p>Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words</p>
<p>herself more admirably than any one I know.”</p>
<p>“I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself. We started such friends. But</p>
<p>I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in</p>
<p>Santa Croce. Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically</p>
<p>alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.”</p>
<p>“The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.”</p>
<p>He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently</p>
<p>dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish. They were always in each</p>
<p>other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he believed he</p>
<p>understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of</p>
<p>strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting her</p>
<p>from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at</p>
<p>Tunbridge Wells? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they</p>
<p>were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample</p>
<p>opportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,</p>
<p>but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his</p>
<p>attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather</p>
<p>than enthralled.</p>
<p>Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped. The</p>
<p>Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts</p>
<p>upon the foreshore. But in the south-west there had appeared a dull</p>
<p>haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean</p>
<p>worse. She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the</p>
<p>room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at</p>
<p>the same moment by the door.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here</p>
<p>besides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually</p>
<p>nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.”</p>
<p>She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was</p>
<p>on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.</p>
<p>“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in</p>
<p>my room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one</p>
<p>has the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches</p>
<p>it from another.”</p>
<p>Lucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of</p>
<p>his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his</p>
<p>bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented</p>
<p>himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan. The Italians</p>
<p>are a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,</p>
<p>and they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their</p>
<p>mercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the</p>
<p>cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.</p>
<p>Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial! They have no</p>
<p>conception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini,</p>
<p>who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I</p>
<p>suffer over the children’s edjucaishion. _Hi_ won’t ’ave my little</p>
<p>Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’”</p>
<p>Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an</p>
<p>agreeable way. Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe,</p>
<p>having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and</p>
<p>who wore a pair of russet whiskers. Indeed, who would have supposed</p>
<p>that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that</p>
<p>militant form?</p>
<p>In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last</p>
<p>the cause was disclosed. From the chair beneath her she extracted a</p>
<p>gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the</p>
<p>initials “E. L.”</p>
<p>“That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman. “A good fellow, Lavish,</p>
<p>but I wish she’d start a pipe.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.</p>
<p>“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as</p>
<p>dreadful as you suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after</p>
<p>her life’s work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it</p>
<p>more excusable.”</p>
<p>“What was that?” asked Lucy.</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It</p>
<p>was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice</p>
<p>novel. It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I</p>
<p>must say they nearly always do. Anyhow, she left it almost finished in</p>
<p>the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she</p>
<p>went for a little ink. She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But</p>
<p>you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to</p>
<p>the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember</p>
<p>what she has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got</p>
<p>tempted into cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say</p>
<p>that she is writing another novel. She told Teresa and Miss Pole the</p>
<p>other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be</p>
<p>about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not</p>
<p>start till she had an idea. First she tried Perugia for an inspiration,</p>
<p>then she came here—this must on no account get round. And so cheerful</p>
<p>through it all! I cannot help thinking that there is something to</p>
<p>admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.”</p>
<p>Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better</p>
<p>judgement. A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving</p>
<p>them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there</p>
<p>sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring. She felt she had made</p>
<p>almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her</p>
<p>toleration.</p>
<p>“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but</p>
<p>she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew</p>
<p>she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole,</p>
<p>the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. That old Mr.</p>
<p>Emerson, who puts things very strangely—”</p>
<p>Her jaw dropped. She was silent. Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were</p>
<p>endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a</p>
<p>hasty whisper:</p>
<p>“Stomach. He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and</p>
<p>he may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed;</p>
<p>it was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But</p>
<p>the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his</p>
<p>mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different</p>
<p>grades of thought. She thought they were commercial</p>
<p>travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she</p>
<p>tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on</p>
<p>nothing but commerce. Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table</p>
<p>before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one</p>
<p>who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful</p>
<p>picture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut! The early</p>
<p>Victorians.’ Just imagine! ‘Tut! The early Victorians.’ My sister had</p>
<p>gone, and I felt bound to speak. I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early</p>
<p>Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure</p>
<p>against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking. I reminded her how</p>
<p>the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must</p>
<p>say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply. But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson</p>
<p>overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!</p>
<p>I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman! I tell things so</p>
<p>badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on</p>
<p>account of S. having been mentioned in the first place. But that was</p>
<p>not all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss</p>
<p>Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.</p>
<p>Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation,</p>
<p>and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas,</p>
<p>and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who</p>
<p>was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial</p>
<p>travellers.”</p>
<p>“Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.</p>
<p>“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I</p>
<p>shall go alone.’ She went. At the end of five minutes she returned</p>
<p>unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.”</p>
<p>“Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.</p>
<p>“No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to</p>
<p>tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice? I do so want to</p>
<p>know.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for</p>
<p>herself.</p>
<p>“No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do</p>
<p>not mind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?”</p>
<p>The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:</p>
<p>“I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after</p>
<p>that business of the violets.”</p>
<p>“Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get</p>
<p>round? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how</p>
<p>they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do</p>
<p>_not_ like the Emersons. They are _not_ nice.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly. He had made a gentle effort to introduce</p>
<p>the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed. He was</p>
<p>almost the only person who remained friendly to them. Miss Lavish, who</p>
<p>represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans,</p>
<p>who stood for good breeding, were following her. Miss Bartlett,</p>
<p>smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy</p>
<p>was different. She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in</p>
<p>Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and</p>
<p>possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from</p>
<p>their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows</p>
<p>and joys. This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be</p>
<p>championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail. After all,</p>
<p>he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are</p>
<p>flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.</p>
<p>Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the</p>
<p>Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now. Even their</p>
<p>seats at dinner had been moved.</p>
<p>“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said</p>
<p>the little lady inquisitively.</p>
<p>“Only once. Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite</p>
<p>politely, of course.”</p>
<p>“Most right of her. They don’t understand our ways. They must find</p>
<p>their level.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under. They had given up their</p>
<p>attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost</p>
<p>as silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant</p>
<p>day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy</p>
<p>well chaperoned to be nice to them. It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief</p>
<p>pleasures to provide people with happy memories.</p>
<p>Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the</p>
<p>colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its</p>
<p>muddy solidity and began to twinkle. There were a few streaks of</p>
<p>bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the</p>
<p>earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in</p>
<p>the declining sun.</p>
<p>“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief. “All the</p>
<p>galleries are shut.”</p>
<p>“I think I shall go out,” said Lucy. “I want to go round the town in</p>
<p>the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.”</p>
<p>Her two companions looked grave. Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for</p>
<p>her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say:</p>
<p>“I wish we could. Unluckily I have letters. If you do want to go out</p>
<p>alone, won’t you be better on your feet?”</p>
<p>“Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!”</p>
<p>But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe</p>
<p>as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the</p>
<p>street frequented by tourists.</p>
<p>“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her</p>
<p>from the window, “and she knows it. I put it down to too much</p>
<p>Beethoven.”</p>
<p>Chapter IV</p>
<p>Fourth Chapter</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe was right. Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after</p>
<p>music. She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the</p>
<p>suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan. Conversation was tedious; she</p>
<p>wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her</p>
<p>on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. This she might not</p>
<p>attempt. It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike?</p>
<p>Charlotte had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were</p>
<p>inferior to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to</p>
<p>inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.</p>
<p>Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could</p>
<p>accomplish much. But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be</p>
<p>first censured, then despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been</p>
<p>written to illustrate this point.</p>
<p>There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady. The dragons have</p>
<p>gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst. She</p>
<p>reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early</p>
<p>Victorian song. It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of</p>
<p>business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.</p>
<p>But alas! the creature grows degenerate. In her heart also there are</p>
<p>springing up strange desires. She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and</p>
<p>vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea. She has marked the</p>
<p>kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a</p>
<p>radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the</p>
<p>receding heavens. Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move</p>
<p>joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with</p>
<p>other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are</p>
<p>alive. Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august</p>
<p>title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.</p>
<p>Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to</p>
<p>which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious. Nor has she</p>
<p>any system of revolt. Here and there a restriction annoyed her</p>
<p>particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that</p>
<p>she had done so. This afternoon she was peculiarly restive. She would</p>
<p>really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved. As</p>
<p>she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.</p>
<p>There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus,</p>
<p>being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it. (A pity in art of course</p>
<p>signified the nude.) Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the</p>
<p>Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it. She felt a</p>
<p>little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s</p>
<p>“Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni</p>
<p>Madonnas. For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical</p>
<p>approval to every well-known name.</p>
<p>But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed</p>
<p>still unopened. She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her</p>
<p>to be conscious of it. “The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of</p>
<p>beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not</p>
<p>surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that</p>
<p>it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.</p>
<p>“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza</p>
<p>Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to</p>
<p>her. The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to</p>
<p>strike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,</p>
<p>half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who</p>
<p>idled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance</p>
<p>of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth</p>
<p>upon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of</p>
<p>unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older</p>
<p>person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient</p>
<p>was happening to him, and rest content. Lucy desired more.</p>
<p>She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out</p>
<p>of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold. It seemed no</p>
<p>longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable</p>
<p>treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her,</p>
<p>still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and</p>
<p>started towards home.</p>
<p>Then something did happen.</p>
<p>Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt. “Cinque</p>
<p>lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and</p>
<p>one of them was hit lightly upon the chest. He frowned; he bent towards</p>
<p>Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for</p>
<p>her. He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out</p>
<p>between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.</p>
<p>That was all. A crowd rose out of the dusk. It hid this extraordinary</p>
<p>man from her, and bore him away to the fountain. Mr. George Emerson</p>
<p>happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where</p>
<p>the man had been. How very odd! Across something. Even as she caught</p>
<p>sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,</p>
<p>fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.</p>
<p>She thought: “Oh, what have I done?”</p>
<p>“Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. She had</p>
<p>complained of dullness, and lo! one man was stabbed, and another held</p>
<p>her in his arms.</p>
<p>They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade. He must have</p>
<p>carried her. He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees. She</p>
<p>repeated:</p>
<p>“Oh, what have I done?”</p>
<p>“You fainted.”</p>
<p>“I—I am very sorry.”</p>
<p>“How are you now?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.</p>
<p>“Then let us come home. There’s no point in our stopping.”</p>
<p>He held out his hand to pull her up. She pretended not to see it. The</p>
<p>cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily. The whole</p>
<p>world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.</p>
<p>“How very kind you have been! I might have hurt myself falling. But now</p>
<p>I am well. I can go alone, thank you.”</p>
<p>His hand was still extended.</p>
<p>“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>“What photographs?”</p>
<p>“I bought some photographs at Alinari’s. I must have dropped them out</p>
<p>there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously. “Would you add to</p>
<p>your kindness by fetching them?”</p>
<p>He added to his kindness. As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose</p>
<p>with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the</p>
<p>Arno.</p>
<p>“Miss Honeychurch!”</p>
<p>She stopped with her hand on her heart.</p>
<p>“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am, thank you so very much.”</p>
<p>“No, you aren’t. You’d go openly if you were.”</p>
<p>“But I had rather—”</p>
<p>“Then I don’t fetch your photographs.”</p>
<p>“I had rather be alone.”</p>
<p>He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit</p>
<p>down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him. “And</p>
<p>don’t move till I come back.”</p>
<p>In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in</p>
<p>dreams. The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,</p>
<p>and joined itself to earth. How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he</p>
<p>returned from the shadowy square? Again the thought occurred to her,</p>
<p>“Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man,</p>
<p>had crossed some spiritual boundary.</p>
<p>He returned, and she talked of the murder. Oddly enough, it was an easy</p>
<p>topic. She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous</p>
<p>over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. Being</p>
<p>strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. She rose</p>
<p>without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her,</p>
<p>she walked firmly enough towards the Arno. There a cabman signalled to</p>
<p>them; they refused him.</p>
<p>“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians</p>
<p>are!—and gave himself up to the police! Mr. Beebe was saying that</p>
<p>Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish. When my</p>
<p>cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?”</p>
<p>He had thrown something into the stream.</p>
<p>“What did you throw in?”</p>
<p>“Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson!”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“Where are the photographs?”</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that</p>
<p>of an anxious boy. Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.</p>
<p>“They were covered with blood. There! I’m glad I’ve told you; and all</p>
<p>the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with</p>
<p>them.” He pointed down-stream. “They’ve gone.” The river swirled under</p>
<p>the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed</p>
<p>better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean</p>
<p>that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man. “For</p>
<p>something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting</p>
<p>muddled. It isn’t exactly that a man has died.”</p>
<p>Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.</p>
<p>“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson—”</p>
<p>He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some</p>
<p>abstract quest.</p>
<p>“I want to ask you something before we go in.”</p>
<p>They were close to their pension. She stopped and leant her elbows</p>
<p>against the parapet of the embankment. He did likewise. There is at</p>
<p>times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that</p>
<p>have suggested to us eternal comradeship. She moved her elbows before</p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>“I have behaved ridiculously.”</p>
<p>He was following his own thoughts.</p>
<p>“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what</p>
<p>came over me.”</p>
<p>“I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude</p>
<p>repelled him.</p>
<p>“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right.”</p>
<p>“And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are</p>
<p>gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t.”</p>
<p>“I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?”</p>
<p>“Your behaviour? Oh, yes, all right—all right.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. And would you—”</p>
<p>She could not carry her request any further. The river was rushing</p>
<p>below them, almost black in the advancing night. He had thrown her</p>
<p>photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason. It struck her</p>
<p>that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man. He would do</p>
<p>her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even</p>
<p>kind; he might even have a high opinion of her. But he lacked chivalry;</p>
<p>his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was</p>
<p>useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete</p>
<p>the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the</p>
<p>knight in that beautiful picture. She had been in his arms, and he</p>
<p>remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that</p>
<p>she had bought in Alinari’s shop. It was not exactly that a man had</p>
<p>died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a</p>
<p>situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the</p>
<p>branching paths of Youth.</p>
<p>“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents</p>
<p>do happen, and then one returns to the old life!”</p>
<p>“I don’t.”</p>
<p>Anxiety moved her to question him.</p>
<p>His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.”</p>
<p>“But why, Mr. Emerson? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I shall want to live, I say.”</p>
<p>Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno,</p>
<p>whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.</p>
<p>Chapter V</p>
<p>Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing</p>
<p>It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte</p>
<p>Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over</p>
<p>Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and</p>
<p>paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson. She and</p>
<p>Miss Lavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the</p>
<p>Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent</p>
<p>and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. It</p>
<p>might have been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match</p>
<p>for any one.</p>
<p>For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone. None of</p>
<p>her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the</p>
<p>embankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at</p>
<p>dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much</p>
<p>Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,</p>
<p>not that she had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her; she was</p>
<p>accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,</p>
<p>contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking</p>
<p>right or wrong.</p>
<p>At breakfast next morning she took decisive action. There were two</p>
<p>plans between which she had to choose. Mr. Beebe was walking up to the</p>
<p>Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party? Charlotte declined for</p>
<p>herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But she</p>
<p>thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing</p>
<p>money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish</p>
<p>alone.</p>
<p>“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth. “It’s very kind of</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.”</p>
<p>“Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure</p>
<p>that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How</p>
<p>abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she should</p>
<p>alter. All morning she would be really nice to her.</p>
<p>She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the</p>
<p>Lung’ Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and</p>
<p>colour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at</p>
<p>it. She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and</p>
<p>your mother could see this, too!”</p>
<p>Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly</p>
<p>where she did.</p>
<p>“Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I</p>
<p>feared you would repent you of your choice.”</p>
<p>Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been</p>
<p>a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down</p>
<p>easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping</p>
<p>were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del</p>
<p>Gallo. Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not</p>
<p>to re-enter it. She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s</p>
<p>insinuations.</p>
<p>But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately</p>
<p>remained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the</p>
<p>river to the Piazza Signoria. She could not have believed that stones,</p>
<p>a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For</p>
<p>a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.</p>
<p>The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss</p>
<p>Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. She hailed them</p>
<p>briskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an</p>
<p>idea which she thought would work up into a book.</p>
<p>“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett. “After your despair</p>
<p>of yesterday! What a fortunate thing!”</p>
<p>“Aha! Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck. Now, you are to</p>
<p>tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy</p>
<p>poked at the ground with her parasol.</p>
<p>“But perhaps you would rather not?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.”</p>
<p>The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable</p>
<p>that a girl should feel deeply.</p>
<p>“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish. “We literary hacks are</p>
<p>shameless creatures. I believe there’s no secret of the human heart</p>
<p>into which we wouldn’t pry.”</p>
<p>She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few</p>
<p>calculations in realism. Then she said that she had been in the Piazza</p>
<p>since eight o’clock collecting material. A good deal of it was</p>
<p>unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had</p>
<p>quarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she should</p>
<p>substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and</p>
<p>at the same time furnish an excellent plot.</p>
<p>“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.</p>
<p>“I do hope she’s nice.”</p>
<p>That desideratum would not be omitted.</p>
<p>“And what is the plot?”</p>
<p>Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while</p>
<p>the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.</p>
<p>“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish</p>
<p>concluded. “It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people. Of</p>
<p>course, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local</p>
<p>colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall</p>
<p>also introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair</p>
<p>warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett. “I am sure you are</p>
<p>thinking of the Emersons.”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.</p>
<p>“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.</p>
<p>It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going</p>
<p>to paint so far as I can. For I repeat and I insist, and I have always</p>
<p>held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less</p>
<p>tragic because it happened in humble life.”</p>
<p>There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the</p>
<p>cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across</p>
<p>the square.</p>
<p>“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett. “That</p>
<p>last remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most</p>
<p>pathetic novel.”</p>
<p>Lucy assented. At present her great aim was not to get put into it. Her</p>
<p>perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that</p>
<p>Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.</p>
<p>“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,”</p>
<p>continued Miss Bartlett slowly. “None but the superficial would be</p>
<p>shocked at her. We had a long talk yesterday. She believes in justice</p>
<p>and truth and human interest. She told me also that she has a high</p>
<p>opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a</p>
<p>pleasant surprise!”</p>
<p>“Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching</p>
<p>you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.”</p>
<p>“We were chatting to Miss Lavish.”</p>
<p>His brow contracted.</p>
<p>“So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!” The last remark</p>
<p>was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with</p>
<p>a courteous smile. “I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and</p>
<p>Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a</p>
<p>drive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.</p>
<p>There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an</p>
<p>hour’s ramble on the hillside. The view thence of Florence is most</p>
<p>beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole. It is the view</p>
<p>that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.</p>
<p>That man had a decided feeling for landscape. Decidedly. But who looks</p>
<p>at it to-day? Ah, the world is too much for us.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that</p>
<p>Mr. Eager was no commonplace chaplain. He was a member of the</p>
<p>residential colony who had made Florence their home. He knew the people</p>
<p>who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta</p>
<p>after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,</p>
<p>and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.</p>
<p>Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in</p>
<p>Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and</p>
<p>exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather</p>
<p>perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their</p>
<p>pockets the coupons of Cook.</p>
<p>Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and</p>
<p>it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who</p>
<p>seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the</p>
<p>permanent. Tea at a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it</p>
<p>yet. But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!</p>
<p>A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life</p>
<p>were grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no</p>
<p>longer the greatest of them. She echoed the raptures of Charlotte</p>
<p>somewhat faintly. Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming</p>
<p>did her thanks become more sincere.</p>
<p>“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain. “In these days</p>
<p>of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message</p>
<p>of purity. Andate via! andate presto, presto! Ah, the town! Beautiful</p>
<p>as it is, it is the town.”</p>
<p>They assented.</p>
<p>“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of</p>
<p>tragedies. To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there</p>
<p>is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and</p>
<p>humiliating.”</p>
<p>“Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett. “Miss Honeychurch happened to</p>
<p>be passing through as it happened. She can hardly bear to speak of it.”</p>
<p>She glanced at Lucy proudly.</p>
<p>“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question. “Do not</p>
<p>blame her, please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her</p>
<p>unchaperoned.”</p>
<p>“So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested</p>
<p>sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing</p>
<p>details would not be unacceptable. His dark, handsome face drooped</p>
<p>mournfully towards her to catch her reply.</p>
<p>“Practically.”</p>
<p>“One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.</p>
<p>“For her also it must have been a terrible experience. I trust that</p>
<p>neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?”</p>
<p>Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable</p>
<p>was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble</p>
<p>after blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.</p>
<p>“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.</p>
<p>“And you and your friend—”</p>
<p>“Were over at the Loggia.”</p>
<p>“That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the</p>
<p>disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public</p>
<p>nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes</p>
<p>on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.”</p>
<p>Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal</p>
<p>league of Italy with youth. He had suddenly extended his book before</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long</p>
<p>glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.</p>
<p>“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of</p>
<p>Fra Angelico’s angels. She tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The</p>
<p>book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.</p>
<p>“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>“Ignore him,” said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away</p>
<p>from the square.</p>
<p>But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a</p>
<p>grievance. His mysterious persecution of Mr. Eager became relentless;</p>
<p>the air rang with his threats and lamentations. He appealed to Lucy;</p>
<p>would not she intercede? He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on</p>
<p>bread. He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied,</p>
<p>he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all</p>
<p>thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.</p>
<p>Shopping was the topic that now ensued. Under the chaplain’s guidance</p>
<p>they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little</p>
<p>picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little</p>
<p>frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out</p>
<p>of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap</p>
<p>mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from</p>
<p>real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and</p>
<p>Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost</p>
<p>less in London.</p>
<p>This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy. She had</p>
<p>been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she</p>
<p>knew not why. And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough,</p>
<p>ceased to respect them. She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great</p>
<p>artist. She doubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and</p>
<p>culture as she had been led to suppose. They were tried by some new</p>
<p>test, and they were found wanting. As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte</p>
<p>she was exactly the same. It might be possible to be nice to her; it</p>
<p>was impossible to love her.</p>
<p>“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact. A mechanic of</p>
<p>some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the</p>
<p>Socialistic Press. I came across him at Brixton.”</p>
<p>They were talking about the Emersons.</p>
<p>“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett,</p>
<p>fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>
<p>“Generally,” replied Mr. Eager, “one has only sympathy for their</p>
<p>success. The desire for education and for social advance—in these</p>
<p>things there is something not wholly vile. There are some working men</p>
<p>whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as</p>
<p>they would make of it.”</p>
<p>“Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.</p>
<p>“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.”</p>
<p>He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a</p>
<p>sigh.</p>
<p>“Oh, so he has a wife.”</p>
<p>“Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead. I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the</p>
<p>effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with</p>
<p>me. He was in my London parish long ago. The other day in Santa Croce,</p>
<p>when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him. Let him beware that</p>
<p>he does not get more than a snub.”</p>
<p>“What?” cried Lucy, flushing.</p>
<p>“Exposure!” hissed Mr. Eager.</p>
<p>He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had</p>
<p>interested his audience more than he had intended. Miss Bartlett was</p>
<p>full of very natural curiosity. Lucy, though she wished never to see</p>
<p>the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.</p>
<p>“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man? We know that</p>
<p>already.”</p>
<p>“Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s</p>
<p>penetration.</p>
<p>“I should be astonished if you knew all. The boy—an innocent child at</p>
<p>the time—I will exclude. God knows what his education and his inherited</p>
<p>qualities may have made him.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not</p>
<p>hear.”</p>
<p>“To speak plainly,” said Mr. Eager, “it is. I will say no more.” For</p>
<p>the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the</p>
<p>first time in her life.</p>
<p>“You have said very little.”</p>
<p>“It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.</p>
<p>He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.</p>
<p>She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved</p>
<p>quickly. He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips. It</p>
<p>was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.</p>
<p>“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily. “That man murdered his</p>
<p>wife!”</p>
<p>“How?” she retorted.</p>
<p>“To all intents and purposes he murdered her. That day in Santa</p>
<p>Croce—did they say anything against me?”</p>
<p>“Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is</p>
<p>only their personal charms that makes you defend them.”</p>
<p>“I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing</p>
<p>into the old chaotic methods. “They’re nothing to me.”</p>
<p>“How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much</p>
<p>discomfited by the unpleasant scene. The shopman was possibly</p>
<p>listening.</p>
<p>“She will find it difficult. For that man has murdered his wife in the</p>
<p>sight of God.”</p>
<p>The addition of God was striking. But the chaplain was really trying to</p>
<p>qualify a rash remark. A silence followed which might have been</p>
<p>impressive, but was merely awkward. Then Miss Bartlett hastily</p>
<p>purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.</p>
<p>“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm</p>
<p>of the approaching drive.</p>
<p>“Drive? Oh, is our drive to come off?”</p>
<p>Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the</p>
<p>complacency of Mr. Eager was restored.</p>
<p>“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. “It</p>
<p>is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at</p>
<p>all. Why should he invite us in that absurd manner? We might as well</p>
<p>invite him. We are each paying for ourselves.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was</p>
<p>launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.</p>
<p>“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.</p>
<p>Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I</p>
<p>foresee a sad kettle of fish.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.”</p>
<p>“That will mean another carriage.”</p>
<p>“Far worse. Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor. She knows it herself. The</p>
<p>truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.”</p>
<p>They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank. Lucy stood by</p>
<p>the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer,</p>
<p>or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain. The</p>
<p>well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic</p>
<p>city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.</p>
<p>Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being</p>
<p>rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets? Was</p>
<p>there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to</p>
<p>evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a</p>
<p>fulfillment?</p>
<p>Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not</p>
<p>matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with</p>
<p>admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost</p>
<p>sight of the goal as she approached it. Now she was crouching in the</p>
<p>corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag</p>
<p>which hung in chaste concealment round her neck. She had been told that</p>
<p>this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be</p>
<p>broached within the walls of the English bank. As she groped she</p>
<p>murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager, or Mr.</p>
<p>Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave</p>
<p>Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we</p>
<p>must be prepared. It is you they really want; I am only asked for</p>
<p>appearances. You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor</p>
<p>will follow behind. A one-horse carriage would do for us. Yet how</p>
<p>difficult it is!”</p>
<p>“It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded</p>
<p>sympathetic.</p>
<p>“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the</p>
<p>struggle, and buttoning up her dress.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear, Lucy! I do hope Florence isn’t boring you. Speak the word,</p>
<p>and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.</p>
<p>There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of</p>
<p>athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her</p>
<p>mother’s letters could be. She had read in it of the crocuses which had</p>
<p>been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new</p>
<p>parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of</p>
<p>the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and</p>
<p>breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway. She recalled the free, pleasant</p>
<p>life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where</p>
<p>nothing ever happened to her. The road up through the pine-woods, the</p>
<p>clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her</p>
<p>bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to</p>
<p>which, after much experience, a traveller returns.</p>
<p>“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news</p>
<p>that interested her least. “Do you know the Vyses?”</p>
<p>“Oh, not that way back. We can never have too much of the dear Piazza</p>
<p>Signoria.”</p>
<p>“They’re nice people, the Vyses. So clever—my idea of what’s really</p>
<p>clever. Don’t you long to be in Rome?”</p>
<p>“I die for it!”</p>
<p>The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant. It has no grass, no</p>
<p>flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting</p>
<p>patches of ruddy brick. By an odd chance—unless we believe in a</p>
<p>presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity</p>
<p>suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment</p>
<p>of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity. Perseus and</p>
<p>Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something,</p>
<p>and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after</p>
<p>experience, not before. Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might</p>
<p>a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.</p>
<p>“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly. “Here’s an idea. What if we</p>
<p>popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel? For I do</p>
<p>know what I want. I’m sick of Florence. No, you said you’d go to the</p>
<p>ends of the earth! Do! Do!”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:</p>
<p>“Oh, you droll person! Pray, what would become of your drive in the</p>
<p>hills?”</p>
<p>They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing</p>
<p>over the unpractical suggestion.</p>
<p>Chapter VI</p>
<p>The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson,</p>
<p>Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and</p>
<p>Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians</p>
<p>Drive Them.</p>
<p>It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth</p>
<p>all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up</p>
<p>the stony hill. Mr. Beebe recognized him at once. Neither the Ages of</p>
<p>Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany</p>
<p>driving a cab. And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on</p>
<p>the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender</p>
<p>and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still</p>
<p>shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light. To her Mr. Eager</p>
<p>objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must</p>
<p>guard against imposition. But the ladies interceded, and when it had</p>
<p>been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was</p>
<p>allowed to mount beside the god.</p>
<p>Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling</p>
<p>himself to drive with his arm round her waist. She did not mind. Mr.</p>
<p>Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the</p>
<p>indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy. The</p>
<p>other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss</p>
<p>Lavish. For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without</p>
<p>consulting Mr. Eager, had doubled the size of the party. And though</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the</p>
<p>people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came</p>
<p>round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.</p>
<p>It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus</p>
<p>transformed. Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,</p>
<p>was now impossible. Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about</p>
<p>them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. But a</p>
<p>shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the</p>
<p>sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.</p>
<p>Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these</p>
<p>explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr. Eager, repressive towards Miss</p>
<p>Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep,</p>
<p>thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring. She looked</p>
<p>on the expedition as the work of Fate. But for it she would have</p>
<p>avoided George Emerson successfully. In an open manner he had shown</p>
<p>that he wished to continue their intimacy. She had refused, not because</p>
<p>she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and</p>
<p>suspected that he did know. And this frightened her.</p>
<p>For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia,</p>
<p>but by the river. To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.</p>
<p>But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and</p>
<p>through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled</p>
<p>emotion, but of the whole fabric. There was really something</p>
<p>blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy</p>
<p>stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house</p>
<p>without the passing of a look or word. This sense of wickedness had</p>
<p>been slight at first. She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del</p>
<p>Gallo. But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative</p>
<p>that she should avoid him again. And now celestial irony, working</p>
<p>through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave</p>
<p>Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was</p>
<p>over.</p>
<p>“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling? As a student of art?”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!”</p>
<p>“Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like</p>
<p>myself?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. I am here as a tourist.”</p>
<p>“Oh, indeed,” said Mr. Eager. “Are you indeed? If you will not think me</p>
<p>rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed</p>
<p>about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to</p>
<p>Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious</p>
<p>of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’</p>
<p>or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else. The result is, they mix up</p>
<p>towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl. You know the American</p>
<p>girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the</p>
<p>father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller</p>
<p>dog.’ There’s travelling for you. Ha! ha! ha!”</p>
<p>“I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to</p>
<p>interrupt his mordant wit. “The narrowness and superficiality of the</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.”</p>
<p>“Quite so. Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it</p>
<p>is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are</p>
<p>here for trade, for example. But the greater part are students. Lady</p>
<p>Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico. I mention her</p>
<p>name because we are passing her villa on the left. No, you can only see</p>
<p>it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall. She is very proud of</p>
<p>that thick hedge. Inside, perfect seclusion. One might have gone back</p>
<p>six hundred years. Some critics believe that her garden was the scene</p>
<p>of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?”</p>
<p>“It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish. “Tell me, where do they place the</p>
<p>scene of that wonderful seventh day?”</p>
<p>But Mr. Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right</p>
<p>lived Mr. Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and</p>
<p>that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill. “Doubtless you know</p>
<p>her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’? He is working at</p>
<p>Gemistus Pletho. Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I</p>
<p>hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with</p>
<p>its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’</p>
<p>Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and</p>
<p>I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.”</p>
<p>During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each</p>
<p>other disgracefully. Lucy had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished</p>
<p>to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were</p>
<p>probably the only people enjoying the expedition. The carriage swept</p>
<p>with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the</p>
<p>Settignano road.</p>
<p>“Piano! piano!” said Mr. Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped</p>
<p>his horses up again.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the</p>
<p>subject of Alessio Baldovinetti. Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or</p>
<p>was he one of its manifestations? The other carriage was left behind.</p>
<p>As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr.</p>
<p>Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a</p>
<p>machine.</p>
<p>“Piano! piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.</p>
<p>An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. Phaethon, who for</p>
<p>some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.</p>
<p>A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was</p>
<p>most unpleasant. The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to</p>
<p>disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl</p>
<p>was immediately to get down.</p>
<p>“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.</p>
<p>Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but</p>
<p>at its manner. At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping</p>
<p>had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated,</p>
<p>and patted them on the back to signify his approval. And Miss Lavish,</p>
<p>though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of</p>
<p>Bohemianism.</p>
<p>“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried. “But I dare say I</p>
<p>shall receive scant support. I have always flown in the face of the</p>
<p>conventions all my life. This is what _I_ call an adventure.”</p>
<p>“We must not submit,” said Mr. Eager. “I knew he was trying it on. He</p>
<p>is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.”</p>
<p>“Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.</p>
<p>The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called</p>
<p>out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave</p>
<p>themselves properly.</p>
<p>“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood</p>
<p>in no awe. “Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off</p>
<p>the box when it happens to sit there? To be driven by lovers—A king</p>
<p>might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than</p>
<p>anything I know.”</p>
<p>Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun</p>
<p>to collect.</p>
<p>Mr. Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a</p>
<p>resolute will, was determined to make himself heard. He addressed the</p>
<p>driver again. Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream,</p>
<p>with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony. In</p>
<p>Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling</p>
<p>fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,</p>
<p>and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a</p>
<p>click.</p>
<p>“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased. Why</p>
<p>should he appeal to Lucy?</p>
<p>“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto. She pointed</p>
<p>at the other carriage. Why?</p>
<p>For a moment the two girls looked at each other. Then Persephone got</p>
<p>down from the box.</p>
<p>“Victory at last!” said Mr. Eager, smiting his hands together as the</p>
<p>carriages started again.</p>
<p>“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson. “It is defeat. You have parted</p>
<p>two people who were happy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Eager shut his eyes. He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but</p>
<p>he would not speak to him. The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took</p>
<p>up the matter warmly. He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted</p>
<p>for support to his son.</p>
<p>“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He has</p>
<p>bargained to drive us, and he is doing it. We have no rights over his</p>
<p>soul.”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish frowned. It is hard when a person you have classed as</p>
<p>typically British speaks out of his character.</p>
<p>“He was not driving us well,” she said. “He jolted us.”</p>
<p>“That I deny. It was as restful as sleeping. Aha! he is jolting us now.</p>
<p>Can you wonder? He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is</p>
<p>justified. And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl,</p>
<p>too. It doesn’t do to injure young people. Have you ever heard of</p>
<p>Lorenzo de Medici?”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish bristled.</p>
<p>“Most certainly I have. Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to</p>
<p>Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of</p>
<p>his diminutive stature?”</p>
<p>“The Lord knows. Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the</p>
<p>poet. He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t</p>
<p>go fighting against the Spring.’”</p>
<p>Mr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.</p>
<p>“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured. “‘War not with the May’ would</p>
<p>render a correct meaning.”</p>
<p>“The point is, we have warred with it. Look.” He pointed to the Val</p>
<p>d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.</p>
<p>“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them. Do you</p>
<p>suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in</p>
<p>man? But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as</p>
<p>improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.”</p>
<p>No one encouraged him to talk. Presently Mr. Eager gave a signal for</p>
<p>the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the</p>
<p>hill. A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and</p>
<p>misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the</p>
<p>road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory</p>
<p>which stood out in the plain. It was this promontory, uncultivated,</p>
<p>wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the</p>
<p>fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. He had</p>
<p>ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an</p>
<p>eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending. Standing there, he</p>
<p>had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he</p>
<p>afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work. But where</p>
<p>exactly had he stood? That was the question which Mr. Eager hoped to</p>
<p>solve now. And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything</p>
<p>problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.</p>
<p>But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in</p>
<p>your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.</p>
<p>And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.</p>
<p>The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to</p>
<p>keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different</p>
<p>directions. Finally they split into groups. Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett</p>
<p>and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with</p>
<p>the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics</p>
<p>in common, were left to each other.</p>
<p>The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. In the audible whisper</p>
<p>that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio</p>
<p>Baldovinetti, but the drive. Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson</p>
<p>what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was</p>
<p>very sorry that she had asked him. She had no idea that it would be</p>
<p>such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. Mr. Beebe had</p>
<p>turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man</p>
<p>was not very much hurt at her asking him.</p>
<p>“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish. “Oh, but I shall die! Of course it</p>
<p>was the railway!” She could not control her mirth. “He is the image of</p>
<p>a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.”</p>
<p>“Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion. “Hush!</p>
<p>They’ll hear—the Emersons—”</p>
<p>“I can’t stop. Let me go my wicked way. A porter—”</p>
<p>“Eleanor!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy. “The Emersons won’t hear, and</p>
<p>they wouldn’t mind if they did.”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.</p>
<p>“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly. “Pouf! Wouf! You</p>
<p>naughty girl! Go away!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr. Eager, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Eager will be offended. It is your party.”</p>
<p>“Please, I’d rather stop here with you.”</p>
<p>“No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish. “It’s like a school feast; the boys</p>
<p>have got separated from the girls. Miss Lucy, you are to go. We wish to</p>
<p>converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.”</p>
<p>The girl was stubborn. As her time at Florence drew to its close she</p>
<p>was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. Such a one</p>
<p>was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte. She wished she</p>
<p>had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her</p>
<p>remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.</p>
<p>“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett. “Oh, I do wish Freddy and</p>
<p>your mother could be here.”</p>
<p>Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of</p>
<p>enthusiasm. Lucy did not look at the view either. She would not enjoy</p>
<p>anything till she was safe at Rome.</p>
<p>“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish. “Observe my foresight.”</p>
<p>With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that</p>
<p>protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.</p>
<p>She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?</p>
<p>“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy. The ground will do for me.</p>
<p>Really I have not had rheumatism for years. If I do feel it coming on I</p>
<p>shall stand. Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet</p>
<p>in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked</p>
<p>particularly moist. “Here we are, all settled delightfully. Even if my</p>
<p>dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. Sit down, dear;</p>
<p>you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared</p>
<p>her throat. “Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold. It’s the tiniest</p>
<p>cough, and I have had it three days. It’s nothing to do with sitting</p>
<p>here at all.”</p>
<p>There was only one way of treating the situation. At the end of five</p>
<p>minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, vanquished</p>
<p>by the mackintosh square.</p>
<p>She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the</p>
<p>carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. The miscreant, a bony</p>
<p>young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the</p>
<p>courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.</p>
<p>“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.</p>
<p>His face lit up. Of course he knew where. Not so far either. His arm</p>
<p>swept three-fourths of the horizon. He should just think he did know</p>
<p>where. He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them</p>
<p>towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.</p>
<p>More seemed necessary. What was the Italian for “clergyman”?</p>
<p>“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.</p>
<p>Good? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! He showed her his</p>
<p>cigar.</p>
<p>“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been</p>
<p>given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?”</p>
<p>She was correct as usual. He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to</p>
<p>make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded</p>
<p>his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of</p>
<p>a minute was ready to conduct her. Italians are born knowing the way.</p>
<p>It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but</p>
<p>as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces</p>
<p>as well as the squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of</p>
<p>people is a gift from God.</p>
<p>He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets. She thanked</p>
<p>him with real pleasure. In the company of this common man the world was</p>
<p>beautiful and direct. For the first time she felt the influence of</p>
<p>Spring. His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other</p>
<p>things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?”</p>
<p>“Ma buoni uomini.”</p>
<p>He bowed. Certainly. Good men first, violets afterwards. They proceeded</p>
<p>briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. They</p>
<p>were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing</p>
<p>round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into</p>
<p>countless pieces. He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the</p>
<p>pliant boughs. She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness. Not a</p>
<p>step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them. The voice</p>
<p>of Mr. Eager? He shrugged his shoulders. An Italian’s ignorance is</p>
<p>sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. She could not make him</p>
<p>understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was</p>
<p>forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other</p>
<p>hills.</p>
<p>“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of</p>
<p>the wood. Light and beauty enveloped her. She had fallen on to a little</p>
<p>open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.</p>
<p>“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.</p>
<p>“Courage and love.”</p>
<p>She did not answer. From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view,</p>
<p>and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating</p>
<p>the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into</p>
<p>pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam. But</p>
<p>never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the</p>
<p>well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the</p>
<p>earth.</p>
<p>Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.</p>
<p>But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.</p>
<p>George had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment he</p>
<p>contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant</p>
<p>joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue</p>
<p>waves. The bushes above them closed. He stepped quickly forward and</p>
<p>kissed her.</p>
<p>Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called,</p>
<p>“Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett who stood brown against the view.</p>
<p>Chapter VII</p>
<p>They Return</p>
<p>Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the</p>
<p>afternoon. What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was</p>
<p>slow to discover. Mr. Eager had met them with a questioning eye.</p>
<p>Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. Mr. Emerson, seeking</p>
<p>his son, was told whereabouts to find him. Mr. Beebe, who wore the</p>
<p>heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the</p>
<p>return home. There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. Pan</p>
<p>had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these</p>
<p>two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social</p>
<p>contretemps and unsuccessful picnics. Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and</p>
<p>had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a</p>
<p>pleasant surprise. Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett. Lucy had lost</p>
<p>Mr. Eager. Mr. Emerson had lost George. Miss Bartlett had lost a</p>
<p>mackintosh square. Phaethon had lost the game.</p>
<p>That last fact was undeniable. He climbed on to the box shivering, with</p>
<p>his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. “Let us</p>
<p>go immediately,” he told them. “The signorino will walk.”</p>
<p>“All the way? He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.</p>
<p>“Apparently. I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the</p>
<p>face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. He alone had</p>
<p>played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had</p>
<p>used scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things</p>
<p>were, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the</p>
<p>message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a</p>
<p>dying man. Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could</p>
<p>interpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly,</p>
<p>and perhaps too late.</p>
<p>The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of</p>
<p>his employers. He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents,</p>
<p>but infinitely the least dangerous. Once back in the town, he and his</p>
<p>insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more. Of</p>
<p>course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the</p>
<p>bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it. But after all, what</p>
<p>have we to do with taverns? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room. It</p>
<p>was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed</p>
<p>downwards towards the fading sun. Lucy sat beside her; Mr. Eager sat</p>
<p>opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious. They</p>
<p>spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.</p>
<p>Rain and darkness came on together. The two ladies huddled together</p>
<p>under an inadequate parasol. There was a lightning flash, and Miss</p>
<p>Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. At the</p>
<p>next flash, Lucy screamed also. Mr. Eager addressed her professionally:</p>
<p>“Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith. If I might say so, there</p>
<p>is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements. Are we</p>
<p>seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical</p>
<p>display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?”</p>
<p>“No—of course—”</p>
<p>“Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being</p>
<p>struck are enormous. The steel knives, the only articles which might</p>
<p>attract the current, are in the other carriage. And, in any case, we</p>
<p>are infinitely safer than if we were walking. Courage—courage and</p>
<p>faith.”</p>
<p>Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand. At</p>
<p>times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not</p>
<p>what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it</p>
<p>afterwards. Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,</p>
<p>gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross</p>
<p>examination.</p>
<p>She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.</p>
<p>“Mr. Eager!” called Mr. Beebe. “We want your assistance. Will you</p>
<p>interpret for us?”</p>
<p>“George!” cried Mr. Emerson. “Ask your driver which way George went.</p>
<p>The boy may lose his way. He may be killed.”</p>
<p>“Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver</p>
<p>is no help. Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.”</p>
<p>“He may be killed!” cried the old man. “He may be killed!”</p>
<p>“Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage. “In</p>
<p>the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.”</p>
<p>“What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.</p>
<p>“Charlotte, how much does Mr. Eager know?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing. But—” she pointed at the</p>
<p>driver—“_he_ knows everything. Dearest, had we better? Shall I?” She</p>
<p>took out her purse. “It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class</p>
<p>people. He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book,</p>
<p>she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.</p>
<p>“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it. As well this ending to his day</p>
<p>as any. But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.</p>
<p>There was an explosion up the road. The storm had struck the overhead</p>
<p>wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen. If they</p>
<p>had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt. They chose to regard</p>
<p>it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity,</p>
<p>which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. They</p>
<p>descended from the carriages; they embraced each other. It was as</p>
<p>joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. For a</p>
<p>moment they realized vast possibilities of good.</p>
<p>The older people recovered quickly. In the very height of their emotion</p>
<p>they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. Miss Lavish calculated that,</p>
<p>even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the</p>
<p>accident. Mr. Eager mumbled a temperate prayer. But the drivers,</p>
<p>through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the</p>
<p>dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.</p>
<p>“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me. Kiss me again. Only you can</p>
<p>understand me. You warned me to be careful. And I—I thought I was</p>
<p>developing.”</p>
<p>“Do not cry, dearest. Take your time.”</p>
<p>“I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse. Once</p>
<p>by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?”</p>
<p>The thought disturbed her repentance. As a matter of fact, the storm</p>
<p>was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she</p>
<p>thought it must be near to everyone.</p>
<p>“I trust not. One would always pray against that.”</p>
<p>“He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.</p>
<p>But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that. I simply</p>
<p>slipped into those violets. No, I want to be really truthful. I am a</p>
<p>little to blame. I had silly thoughts. The sky, you know, was gold, and</p>
<p>the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a</p>
<p>book.”</p>
<p>“In a book?”</p>
<p>“Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.”</p>
<p>“And then?”</p>
<p>“But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was silent. Indeed, she had little more to learn. With a</p>
<p>certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to</p>
<p>her. All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which</p>
<p>nothing could repress.</p>
<p>“I want to be truthful,” she whispered. “It is so hard to be absolutely</p>
<p>truthful.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be troubled, dearest. Wait till you are calmer. We will talk it</p>
<p>over before bed-time in my room.”</p>
<p>So they re-entered the city with hands clasped. It was a shock to the</p>
<p>girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. The storm had ceased,</p>
<p>and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son. Mr. Beebe had regained good</p>
<p>humour, and Mr. Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish. Charlotte alone</p>
<p>she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and</p>
<p>love.</p>
<p>The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long</p>
<p>evening. She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she</p>
<p>should describe it. All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her</p>
<p>moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be</p>
<p>carefully laid before her cousin. And together in divine confidence</p>
<p>they would disentangle and interpret them all.</p>
<p>“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself. I shan’t again be</p>
<p>troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know</p>
<p>what.”</p>
<p>Miss Alan asked her to play. She refused vehemently. Music seemed to</p>
<p>her the employment of a child. She sat close to her cousin, who, with</p>
<p>commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.</p>
<p>When it was over she capped it by a story of her own. Lucy became</p>
<p>rather hysterical with the delay. In vain she tried to check, or at all</p>
<p>events to accelerate, the tale. It was not till a late hour that Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of</p>
<p>gentle reproach:</p>
<p>“Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire. Come into my</p>
<p>room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.”</p>
<p>With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the</p>
<p>girl. Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?”</p>
<p>She was unprepared for the question. It had not occurred to her that</p>
<p>she would have to do anything. A detailed exhibition of her emotions</p>
<p>was all that she had counted upon.</p>
<p>“What is to be done? A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.”</p>
<p>The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt</p>
<p>damp and chilly. One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers</p>
<p>close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic</p>
<p>shadows on the bolted door. A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt</p>
<p>unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. She lifted</p>
<p>them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless</p>
<p>and vague, the very ghosts of joy.</p>
<p>“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.</p>
<p>“How do you propose to silence him?”</p>
<p>“The driver?”</p>
<p>“My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.”</p>
<p>Lucy began to pace up and down the room.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” she said at last.</p>
<p>She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely</p>
<p>truthful.</p>
<p>“How are you going to stop him talking about it?”</p>
<p>“I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.”</p>
<p>“I, too, intend to judge him charitably. But unfortunately I have met</p>
<p>the type before. They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.”</p>
<p>“Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.</p>
<p>“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first? Come here and</p>
<p>listen to me. I am only gathering it from his own remarks. Do you</p>
<p>remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking</p>
<p>one person is an extra reason for liking another?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.</p>
<p>“Well, I am no prude. There is no need to call him a wicked young man,</p>
<p>but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined. Let us put it down to his</p>
<p>deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish. But we are no</p>
<p>farther on with our question. What do you propose to do?”</p>
<p>An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner</p>
<p>and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.</p>
<p>“I propose to speak to him,” said she.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.</p>
<p>“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it. But—as you</p>
<p>said—it is my affair. Mine and his.”</p>
<p>“And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not. There would be no difficulty. Whatever you ask him he</p>
<p>answers, yes or no; then it is over. I have been frightened of him. But</p>
<p>now I am not one little bit.”</p>
<p>“But we fear him for you, dear. You are so young and inexperienced, you</p>
<p>have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can</p>
<p>be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her</p>
<p>sex does not protect and rally round. This afternoon, for example, if I</p>
<p>had not arrived, what would have happened?”</p>
<p>“I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.</p>
<p>Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning</p>
<p>it more vigorously.</p>
<p>“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?”</p>
<p>“I can’t think,” said Lucy again.</p>
<p>“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t time to think. You came.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?”</p>
<p>“I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off. She</p>
<p>went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.</p>
<p>She could not think what she would have done.</p>
<p>“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett. “You will be</p>
<p>seen from the road.”</p>
<p>Lucy obeyed. She was in her cousin’s power. She could not modulate out</p>
<p>the key of self-abasement in which she had started. Neither of them</p>
<p>referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and</p>
<p>settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett became plaintive.</p>
<p>“Oh, for a real man! We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is</p>
<p>hopeless. There is Mr. Eager, but you do not trust him. Oh, for your</p>
<p>brother! He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse</p>
<p>in him a very lion. Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead. There are</p>
<p>still left some men who can reverence woman.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and</p>
<p>ranged them upon the pin cushion. Then she blew into her gloves and</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>“It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.”</p>
<p>“What train?”</p>
<p>“The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.</p>
<p>The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.</p>
<p>“When does the train to Rome go?”</p>
<p>“At eight.”</p>
<p>“Signora Bertolini would be upset.”</p>
<p>“We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had</p>
<p>given notice already.</p>
<p>“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.”</p>
<p>“I expect she will. However, we shall be much more comfortable at the</p>
<p>Vyses’ hotel. Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained</p>
<p>motionless and silent. To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled</p>
<p>like a ghostly figure in a dream.</p>
<p>They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to</p>
<p>lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome. Lucy, when admonished,</p>
<p>began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the</p>
<p>discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte,</p>
<p>who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk,</p>
<p>vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and</p>
<p>size. She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her</p>
<p>back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.</p>
<p>The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of</p>
<p>those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.</p>
<p>She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier,</p>
<p>the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.</p>
<p>The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly. She knelt</p>
<p>down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth. But she</p>
<p>was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not</p>
<p>love her, but needed her to love. For it was in ominous tones that she</p>
<p>said, after a long pause:</p>
<p>“Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?”</p>
<p>Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what</p>
<p>forgiving Miss Bartlett meant. Her emotion relaxed, she modified her</p>
<p>embrace a little, and she said:</p>
<p>“Charlotte dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!”</p>
<p>“You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself,</p>
<p>too. I know well how much I vex you at every turn.”</p>
<p>“But no—”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged</p>
<p>martyr.</p>
<p>“Ah, but yes! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had</p>
<p>hoped. I might have known it would not do. You want someone younger and</p>
<p>stronger and more in sympathy with you. I am too uninteresting and</p>
<p>old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.”</p>
<p>“Please—”</p>
<p>“My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and</p>
<p>were often able to leave me at home. I had my own poor ideas of what a</p>
<p>lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than</p>
<p>was necessary. You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.”</p>
<p>“You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.</p>
<p>She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other,</p>
<p>heart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.</p>
<p>“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the</p>
<p>straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own. “Failed to make</p>
<p>you happy; failed in my duty to your mother. She has been so generous</p>
<p>to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.”</p>
<p>“But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it</p>
<p>isn’t a disaster either.”</p>
<p>“It is my fault, it is a disaster. She will never forgive me, and</p>
<p>rightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss</p>
<p>Lavish?”</p>
<p>“Every right.”</p>
<p>“When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true</p>
<p>that I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I</p>
<p>do, when you tell her.”</p>
<p>Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said:</p>
<p>“Why need mother hear of it?”</p>
<p>“But you tell her everything?”</p>
<p>“I suppose I do generally.”</p>
<p>“I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.</p>
<p>Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.”</p>
<p>The girl would not be degraded to this.</p>
<p>“Naturally I should have told her. But in case she should blame you in</p>
<p>any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to. I will never</p>
<p>speak of it either to her or to any one.”</p>
<p>Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close. Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and</p>
<p>sent her to her own room.</p>
<p>For a moment the original trouble was in the background. George would</p>
<p>seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view</p>
<p>which one would take eventually. At present she neither acquitted nor</p>
<p>condemned him; she did not pass judgement. At the moment when she was</p>
<p>about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since,</p>
<p>it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now,</p>
<p>could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor</p>
<p>inconsistent. She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed,</p>
<p>for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented</p>
<p>to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in</p>
<p>which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a</p>
<p>shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but</p>
<p>which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have</p>
<p>used them most.</p>
<p>Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has</p>
<p>yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity,</p>
<p>of her craving for sympathy and love. Such a wrong is not easily</p>
<p>forgotten. Never again did she expose herself without due consideration</p>
<p>and precaution against rebuff. And such a wrong may react disastrously</p>
<p>upon the soul.</p>
<p>The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters. Before she reached</p>
<p>them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle. Thus it was that,</p>
<p>though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked</p>
<p>up, did not see her.</p>
<p>To reach his room he had to go by hers. She was still dressed. It</p>
<p>struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she</p>
<p>would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary</p>
<p>intercourse was over.</p>
<p>Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved. At the</p>
<p>critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said:</p>
<p>“I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.”</p>
<p>Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr.</p>
<p>Emerson.”</p>
<p>His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done</p>
<p>her work.</p>
<p>Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true. It can’t all be true. I want not to</p>
<p>be muddled. I want to grow older quickly.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.</p>
<p>“Go to bed at once, dear. You need all the rest you can get.”</p>
<p>In the morning they left for Rome.</p>
<p>PART TWO</p>
<p>Chapter VIII</p>
<p>Medieval</p>
<p>The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for</p>
<p>the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun. They</p>
<p>were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that</p>
<p>filtered through them was subdued and varied. A poet—none was</p>
<p>present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,”</p>
<p>or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against</p>
<p>the intolerable tides of heaven. Without was poured a sea of radiance;</p>
<p>within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>Two pleasant people sat in the room. One—a boy of nineteen—was studying</p>
<p>a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay</p>
<p>upon the piano. From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed</p>
<p>and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human</p>
<p>frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did</p>
<p>continually read out to him what she had written. And continually did</p>
<p>she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light</p>
<p>fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.</p>
<p>“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother. “I</p>
<p>tell you I’m getting fairly sick.”</p>
<p>“For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it</p>
<p>literally.</p>
<p>Freddy did not move or reply.</p>
<p>“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her</p>
<p>son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue</p>
<p>supplication.</p>
<p>“Time they did.”</p>
<p>“I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.”</p>
<p>“It’s his third go, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might</p>
<p>have got this off her chest in Italy. I don’t know how girls manage</p>
<p>things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t</p>
<p>have to say it again now. Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do</p>
<p>feel so uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“Do you indeed, dear? How interesting!”</p>
<p>“I feel—never mind.”</p>
<p>He returned to his work.</p>
<p>“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse. I said: ‘Dear Mrs.</p>
<p>Vyse.’”</p>
<p>“Yes, mother, you told me. A jolly good letter.”</p>
<p>“I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it,</p>
<p>and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it. But—’” She stopped</p>
<p>reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all. He</p>
<p>has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so</p>
<p>forth. When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.”</p>
<p>“Nor me.”</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>Freddy nodded.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“He asked me for my permission also.”</p>
<p>She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!”</p>
<p>“Why so?” asked the son and heir. “Why shouldn’t my permission be</p>
<p>asked?”</p>
<p>“What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything? What ever did you</p>
<p>say?”</p>
<p>“I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’”</p>
<p>“What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its</p>
<p>wording, had been to the same effect.</p>
<p>“The bother is this,” began Freddy.</p>
<p>Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.</p>
<p>“Freddy, you must come. There they still are!”</p>
<p>“I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.”</p>
<p>“Peeping like that! Can’t I look out of my own window?”</p>
<p>But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her</p>
<p>son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves. For</p>
<p>a brief space they were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the</p>
<p>gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.</p>
<p>“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.”</p>
<p>He gave a nervous gulp. “Not content with ‘permission’, which I did</p>
<p>give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with</p>
<p>that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy. He</p>
<p>practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and</p>
<p>for Windy Corner generally if he married her? And he would have an</p>
<p>answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.”</p>
<p>“I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.”</p>
<p>“I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth. “There! Fly into a</p>
<p>stew! I can’t help it—had to say it. I had to say no. He ought never to</p>
<p>have asked me.”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous child!” cried his mother. “You think you’re so holy and</p>
<p>truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that</p>
<p>a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I</p>
<p>hope he boxed your ears. How dare you say no?”</p>
<p>“Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes. I</p>
<p>tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed</p>
<p>too, and went away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot’s in it.</p>
<p>Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the</p>
<p>subject, “I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between</p>
<p>them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately</p>
<p>insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.”</p>
<p>“Not a bit!” he pleaded. “I only let out I didn’t like him. I don’t</p>
<p>hate him, but I don’t like him. What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.”</p>
<p>He glanced at the curtains dismally.</p>
<p>“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “I know his mother; he’s</p>
<p>good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick</p>
<p>the piano! He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well</p>
<p>connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face</p>
<p>remained dissatisfied. She added: “And he has beautiful manners.”</p>
<p>“I liked him till just now. I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s</p>
<p>first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not</p>
<p>knowing.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest. “I don’t</p>
<p>see how Mr. Beebe comes in.”</p>
<p>“You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he</p>
<p>means. He said: ‘Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I</p>
<p>asked him what he meant. He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I</p>
<p>couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking. Since Cecil has</p>
<p>come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.”</p>
<p>“You never can, dear. But I can. You are jealous of Cecil because he</p>
<p>may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.”</p>
<p>The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it. But at</p>
<p>the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust. Cecil praised one</p>
<p>too much for being athletic. Was that it? Cecil made one talk in one’s</p>
<p>own way. This tired one. Was that it? And Cecil was the kind of fellow</p>
<p>who would never wear another fellow’s cap. Unaware of his own</p>
<p>profundity, Freddy checked himself. He must be jealous, or he would not</p>
<p>dislike a man for such foolish reasons.</p>
<p>“Will this do?” called his mother. “‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just</p>
<p>asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes</p>
<p>it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write</p>
<p>the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very</p>
<p>uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’</p>
<p>I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.</p>
<p>She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a</p>
<p>thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks</p>
<p>where you turn on the electric light. She keeps that flat abominably—”</p>
<p>“Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the</p>
<p>country?”</p>
<p>“Don’t interrupt so foolishly. Where was I? Oh yes—‘Young people must</p>
<p>decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your son, because she</p>
<p>tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her</p>
<p>first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing. I’ll</p>
<p>stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out,</p>
<p>too?”</p>
<p>“Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.</p>
<p>“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my</p>
<p>permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I</p>
<p>have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days</p>
<p>young people must decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your</p>
<p>son, because she tells me everything. But I do not know—’”</p>
<p>“Look out!” cried Freddy.</p>
<p>The curtains parted.</p>
<p>Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation. He couldn’t bear the</p>
<p>Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.</p>
<p>Instinctively he gave the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging</p>
<p>down their poles. Light entered. There was revealed a terrace, such as</p>
<p>is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little</p>
<p>rustic seat, and two flower-beds. But it was transfigured by the view</p>
<p>beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the</p>
<p>Sussex Weald. Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a</p>
<p>green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.</p>
<p>Cecil entered.</p>
<p>Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described. He</p>
<p>was medieval. Like a Gothic statue. Tall and refined, with shoulders</p>
<p>that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was</p>
<p>tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled</p>
<p>those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.</p>
<p>Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained</p>
<p>in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as</p>
<p>self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,</p>
<p>worshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a</p>
<p>Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe</p>
<p>meant. And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same</p>
<p>when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards</p>
<p>her young acquaintance.</p>
<p>“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!”</p>
<p>“I promessi sposi,” said he.</p>
<p>They stared at him anxiously.</p>
<p>“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English</p>
<p>made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.</p>
<p>“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand</p>
<p>that was yellow with chemicals. They wished that they also knew</p>
<p>Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected</p>
<p>with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones. We are</p>
<p>obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural</p>
<p>reminiscences.</p>
<p>“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand</p>
<p>at the furniture. “This is indeed a joyous day! I feel sure that you</p>
<p>will make our dear Lucy happy.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.</p>
<p>“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was</p>
<p>affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most. Why</p>
<p>could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room;</p>
<p>looking very cross and almost handsome?</p>
<p>“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.</p>
<p>Lucy rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at</p>
<p>them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw</p>
<p>her brother’s face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He</p>
<p>said, “Steady on!”</p>
<p>“Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.</p>
<p>Lucy kissed her also.</p>
<p>“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all</p>
<p>about it?” Cecil suggested. “And I’d stop here and tell my mother.”</p>
<p>“We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.</p>
<p>“Yes, you go with Lucy.”</p>
<p>They passed into the sunlight. Cecil watched them cross the terrace,</p>
<p>and descend out of sight by the steps. They would descend—he knew their</p>
<p>ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,</p>
<p>until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of</p>
<p>the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.</p>
<p>Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that</p>
<p>had led to such a happy conclusion.</p>
<p>He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who</p>
<p>happened to be musical. He could still remember his depression that</p>
<p>afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of</p>
<p>the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s. That day she had</p>
<p>seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel. But</p>
<p>Italy worked some marvel in her. It gave her light, and—which he held</p>
<p>more precious—it gave her shadow. Soon he detected in her a wonderful</p>
<p>reticence. She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love</p>
<p>not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.</p>
<p>The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could</p>
<p>have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully</p>
<p>day by day.</p>
<p>So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if</p>
<p>not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness. Already at Rome he</p>
<p>had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other. It had</p>
<p>touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion. Her</p>
<p>refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase</p>
<p>went—she had been exactly the same to him as before. Three months</p>
<p>later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked</p>
<p>her again in bald, traditional language. She reminded him of a Leonardo</p>
<p>more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock;</p>
<p>at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with</p>
<p>immeasurable plains behind her. He walked home with her unashamed,</p>
<p>feeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really</p>
<p>mattered were unshaken.</p>
<p>So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she</p>
<p>had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply</p>
<p>saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy. His</p>
<p>mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must</p>
<p>write her a long account.</p>
<p>Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on</p>
<p>it, he moved to the writing table. There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,”</p>
<p>followed by many erasures. He recoiled without reading any more, and</p>
<p>after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on</p>
<p>his knee.</p>
<p>Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as</p>
<p>the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner</p>
<p>drawing-room more distinctive. With that outlook it should have been a</p>
<p>successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he</p>
<p>could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.</p>
<p>Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished</p>
<p>book-cases, that writing-table. The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s</p>
<p>letter. He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay</p>
<p>in that direction; but he worried about it none the less. It was his</p>
<p>own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted</p>
<p>her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that</p>
<p>others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked</p>
<p>their permission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in</p>
<p>essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected. “I</p>
<p>represent all that he despises. Why should he want me for a</p>
<p>brother-in-law?”</p>
<p>The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that</p>
<p>Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very</p>
<p>definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as</p>
<p>soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was</p>
<p>shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s</p>
<p>praise of him in her letters from Florence.</p>
<p>Cecil greeted him rather critically.</p>
<p>“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?”</p>
<p>“I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that</p>
<p>chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.”</p>
<p>“Pfui!”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Cecil. “I know. I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch</p>
<p>allows it.”</p>
<p>For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he</p>
<p>did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the</p>
<p>life that he desired.</p>
<p>“I’ve come for tea and for gossip. Isn’t this news?”</p>
<p>“News? I don’t understand you,” said Cecil. “News?”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.</p>
<p>“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I</p>
<p>am first in the field. He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!”</p>
<p>“Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a</p>
<p>grotesque mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a</p>
<p>gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? But</p>
<p>his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert</p>
<p>might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.</p>
<p>“Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not</p>
<p>to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been</p>
<p>run up opposite the church! I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.”</p>
<p>“I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man</p>
<p>languidly. “I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish</p>
<p>Council and a Local Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference,</p>
<p>or perhaps those aren’t the right names. I only go into the country to</p>
<p>see my friends and to enjoy the scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy</p>
<p>and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on</p>
<p>sufferance.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert,</p>
<p>determined to shift the subject.</p>
<p>“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?”</p>
<p>“I have no profession,” said Cecil. “It is another example of my</p>
<p>decadence. My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I</p>
<p>am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought</p>
<p>to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t</p>
<p>care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.”</p>
<p>“You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe. “It is a wonderful</p>
<p>opportunity, the possession of leisure.”</p>
<p>His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to</p>
<p>answering naturally. He felt, as all who have regular occupation must</p>
<p>feel, that others should have it also.</p>
<p>“I am glad that you approve. I daren’t face the healthy person—for</p>
<p>example, Freddy Honeychurch.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Admirable. The sort who has made England what she is.”</p>
<p>Cecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he so</p>
<p>hopelessly contrary? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively</p>
<p>after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular</p>
<p>regard. Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his</p>
<p>liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and</p>
<p>science.</p>
<p>“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting</p>
<p>tea before evening service.”</p>
<p>“I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so</p>
<p>coached in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is that</p>
<p>she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the</p>
<p>chair-legs with her feet. The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of</p>
<p>Mary, but they are very grave. Shall we look in the garden?”</p>
<p>“I know the faults of Mary. She leaves the dust-pans standing on the</p>
<p>stairs.”</p>
<p>“The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the</p>
<p>suet sufficiently small.”</p>
<p>They both laughed, and things began to go better.</p>
<p>“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.</p>
<p>“Ah, he has too many. No one but his mother can remember the faults of</p>
<p>Freddy. Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.”</p>
<p>“She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.</p>
<p>“I quite agree. At present she has none.”</p>
<p>“At present?”</p>
<p>“I’m not cynical. I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch. Does it seem reasonable that she should play so</p>
<p>wonderfully, and live so quietly? I suspect that one day she will be</p>
<p>wonderful in both. The water-tight compartments in her will break down,</p>
<p>and music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her heroically good,</p>
<p>heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.”</p>
<p>Cecil found his companion interesting.</p>
<p>“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?”</p>
<p>“Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was</p>
<p>not wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she has</p>
<p>been away. You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I</p>
<p>forgot; of course, you knew her before. No, she wasn’t wonderful in</p>
<p>Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.”</p>
<p>“In what way?”</p>
<p>Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and</p>
<p>down the terrace.</p>
<p>“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next. There was</p>
<p>simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. I can</p>
<p>show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a</p>
<p>kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string</p>
<p>breaks.”</p>
<p>The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he</p>
<p>viewed things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs</p>
<p>to the string himself.</p>
<p>“But the string never broke?”</p>
<p>“No. I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly</p>
<p>have heard Miss Bartlett fall.”</p>
<p>“It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.</p>
<p>Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,</p>
<p>contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He</p>
<p>cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and</p>
<p>that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?</p>
<p>“Broken? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.”</p>
<p>The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he</p>
<p>could not keep out of his voice.</p>
<p>“I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with</p>
<p>her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.</p>
<p>Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw</p>
<p>Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.</p>
<p>Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down</p>
<p>his mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get</p>
<p>from the world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every</p>
<p>thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he was</p>
<p>sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.</p>
<p>Occasionally he could be quite crude.</p>
<p>“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly. “I fear that</p>
<p>Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.”</p>
<p>“Not that. But you ought to have stopped me. I know Miss Honeychurch</p>
<p>only a little as time goes. Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so</p>
<p>freely with any one; certainly not with you.”</p>
<p>“You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of</p>
<p>placing one in the most tiresome positions. He was driven to use the</p>
<p>prerogatives of his profession.</p>
<p>“No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her</p>
<p>quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized</p>
<p>dimly enough that she might take some momentous step. She has taken it.</p>
<p>She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she</p>
<p>has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will</p>
<p>tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to</p>
<p>wave his hat at the approaching trio. He did not omit to do so. “She</p>
<p>has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was</p>
<p>now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable</p>
<p>to her.”</p>
<p>“Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.</p>
<p>“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping</p>
<p>garden. “Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?”</p>
<p>Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom</p>
<p>criticizes the accomplished fact.</p>
<p>“Indeed I have!” he cried. He looked at Lucy. In her presence he could</p>
<p>not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology. “Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but</p>
<p>generally I’m too shy. I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them,</p>
<p>grave and gay, great and small. I want them all their lives to be</p>
<p>supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and</p>
<p>mother. And now I want my tea.”</p>
<p>“You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted. “How dare you</p>
<p>be serious at Windy Corner?”</p>
<p>He took his tone from her. There was no more heavy beneficence, no more</p>
<p>attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None</p>
<p>of them dared or was able to be serious any more.</p>
<p>An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all</p>
<p>who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the</p>
<p>solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be</p>
<p>critical. But in its presence and in the presence of each other they</p>
<p>were sincerely hilarious. It has a strange power, for it compels not</p>
<p>only the lips, but the very heart. The chief parallel to compare one</p>
<p>great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien</p>
<p>creed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel</p>
<p>sentimental. Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become</p>
<p>true believers, in case any true believer should be present.</p>
<p>So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon</p>
<p>they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant</p>
<p>tea-party. If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their</p>
<p>hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. Anne,</p>
<p>putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated</p>
<p>them greatly. They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she</p>
<p>gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe chirruped.</p>
<p>Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family</p>
<p>honoured pun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised</p>
<p>well as a mother-in-law. As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had</p>
<p>been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as</p>
<p>earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of</p>
<p>joy.</p>
<p>Chapter IX</p>
<p>Lucy As a Work of Art</p>
<p>A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made</p>
<p>Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood,</p>
<p>for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying</p>
<p>a presentable man.</p>
<p>Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was</p>
<p>very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his</p>
<p>long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him. People congratulated</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased</p>
<p>her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy</p>
<p>dowagers.</p>
<p>At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s</p>
<p>figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned</p>
<p>nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated</p>
<p>by a sympathetic maid. They were gone some time, and Cecil was left</p>
<p>with the dowagers. When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had</p>
<p>been.</p>
<p>“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were</p>
<p>driving home.</p>
<p>“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.</p>
<p>“Is it typical of country society?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. Mother, would it be?”</p>
<p>“Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember</p>
<p>the hang of one of the dresses.</p>
<p>Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>“To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.”</p>
<p>“I am so sorry that you were stranded.”</p>
<p>“Not that, but the congratulations. It is so disgusting, the way an</p>
<p>engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where</p>
<p>every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment. All those old women</p>
<p>smirking!”</p>
<p>“One has to go through it, I suppose. They won’t notice us so much next</p>
<p>time.”</p>
<p>“But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong. An</p>
<p>engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and</p>
<p>should be treated as such.”</p>
<p>Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially</p>
<p>correct. The spirit of the generations had smiled through them,</p>
<p>rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the</p>
<p>continuance of life on earth. To Cecil and Lucy it promised something</p>
<p>quite different—personal love. Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s</p>
<p>belief that his irritation was just.</p>
<p>“How tiresome!” she said. “Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?”</p>
<p>“I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public. The neighbourhood is</p>
<p>deprived of the romance of me being athletic. Such romance as I have is</p>
<p>that of the Inglese Italianato.”</p>
<p>“Inglese Italianato?”</p>
<p>“E un diavolo incarnato! You know the proverb?”</p>
<p>She did not. Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a</p>
<p>quiet winter in Rome with his mother. But Cecil, since his engagement,</p>
<p>had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from</p>
<p>possessing.</p>
<p>“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There</p>
<p>are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must</p>
<p>accept them.”</p>
<p>“We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.</p>
<p>“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her</p>
<p>remark that she did not quite understand his position.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in,</p>
<p>or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?”</p>
<p>She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.</p>
<p>“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert. “I don’t see any</p>
<p>difference. Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same</p>
<p>place.”</p>
<p>“We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption</p>
<p>jarred.</p>
<p>“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her</p>
<p>card-case on her lap. “This is me. That’s Windy Corner. The rest of the</p>
<p>pattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence</p>
<p>comes here.”</p>
<p>“We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.”</p>
<p>She leant placidly back. Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.</p>
<p>“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and</p>
<p>that’s Mr. Beebe.”</p>
<p>“A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.”</p>
<p>Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect</p>
<p>what they meant. She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling</p>
<p>that prompted it.</p>
<p>“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I never said so!” he cried. “I consider him far above the average. I</p>
<p>only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was</p>
<p>brilliant.</p>
<p>“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something</p>
<p>sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful</p>
<p>ones, is Mr. Eager, the English chaplain at Florence. He was truly</p>
<p>insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate. He was a snob, and so</p>
<p>conceited, and he did say such unkind things.”</p>
<p>“What sort of things?”</p>
<p>“There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his</p>
<p>wife.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he had.”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Why ‘no’?”</p>
<p>“He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.</p>
<p>“Well, I did try to sift the thing. Mr. Eager would never come to the</p>
<p>point. He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered</p>
<p>his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.”</p>
<p>“Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.</p>
<p>“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate</p>
<p>should go round spreading slander? It was, I believe, chiefly owing to</p>
<p>him that the old man was dropped. People pretended he was vulgar, but</p>
<p>he certainly wasn’t that.”</p>
<p>“Poor old man! What was his name?”</p>
<p>“Harris,” said Lucy glibly.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her</p>
<p>mother.</p>
<p>Cecil nodded intelligently.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I hate him. I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto. I hate</p>
<p>him. Nothing can hide a petty nature. I _hate_ him.”</p>
<p>“My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “You’ll blow</p>
<p>my head off! Whatever is there to shout over? I forbid you and Cecil to</p>
<p>hate any more clergymen.”</p>
<p>He smiled. There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s</p>
<p>moral outburst over Mr. Eager. It was as if one should see the Leonardo</p>
<p>on the ceiling of the Sistine. He longed to hint to her that not here</p>
<p>lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not</p>
<p>in muscular rant. But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the</p>
<p>beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive. After a moment, he</p>
<p>contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain</p>
<p>approval. He forebore to repress the sources of youth.</p>
<p>Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them. He praised the</p>
<p>pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted</p>
<p>the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road. The</p>
<p>outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went</p>
<p>wrong in a question of fact. Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he</p>
<p>spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.</p>
<p>“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I</p>
<p>feel I could never live out of it. When I’m in the country I feel the</p>
<p>same about the country. After all, I do believe that birds and trees</p>
<p>and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people</p>
<p>who live amongst them must be the best. It’s true that in nine cases</p>
<p>out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything. The country gentleman</p>
<p>and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of</p>
<p>companions. Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of</p>
<p>Nature which is denied to us of the town. Do you feel that, Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled. She had not been attending. Cecil,</p>
<p>who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt</p>
<p>irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.</p>
<p>Lucy had not attended either. Her brow was wrinkled, and she still</p>
<p>looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral</p>
<p>gymnastics. It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an</p>
<p>August wood.</p>
<p>“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and</p>
<p>touched her knee with his own.</p>
<p>She flushed again and said: “What height?”</p>
<p>“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,</p>
<p>What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).</p>
<p>In height and in the splendour of the hills?’</p>
<p>Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.</p>
<p>What’s this place?”</p>
<p>“Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.</p>
<p>The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.</p>
<p>Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was</p>
<p>occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled</p>
<p>spire. Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church. In height it scarcely</p>
<p>exceeded the cottages. Some great mansions were at hand, but they were</p>
<p>hidden in the trees. The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the</p>
<p>shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly</p>
<p>little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement,</p>
<p>having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy</p>
<p>had been acquired by Cecil.</p>
<p>“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.</p>
<p>These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden</p>
<p>gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed</p>
<p>the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. “Albert”</p>
<p>was inhabited. His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and</p>
<p>lobelias and polished shells. His little windows were chastely swathed</p>
<p>in Nottingham lace. “Cissie” was to let. Three notice-boards, belonging</p>
<p>to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising</p>
<p>fact. Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn</p>
<p>was yellow with dandelions.</p>
<p>“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically. “Summer Street</p>
<p>will never be the same again.”</p>
<p>As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came</p>
<p>out of her.</p>
<p>“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.</p>
<p>“Here’s Sir Harry. Now we shall know. Sir Harry, pull those things down</p>
<p>at once!”</p>
<p>Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said</p>
<p>“Mrs. Honeychurch, I meant to. I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss</p>
<p>Flack.”</p>
<p>“Am I not always right? She ought to have gone before the contract was</p>
<p>signed. Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s</p>
<p>time?”</p>
<p>“But what can I do?” He lowered his voice. “An old lady, so very</p>
<p>vulgar, and almost bedridden.”</p>
<p>“Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.</p>
<p>Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully. He had had full</p>
<p>warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot</p>
<p>before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory. He had</p>
<p>known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it</p>
<p>being spoilt. Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and</p>
<p>the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.</p>
<p>He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and</p>
<p>respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic</p>
<p>roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper. He ventured to differ,</p>
<p>however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches</p>
<p>to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked</p>
<p>to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration. Sir Harry hinted that a</p>
<p>column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.</p>
<p>Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and</p>
<p>all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another</p>
<p>approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s</p>
<p>initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin. He built his</p>
<p>villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an</p>
<p>immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.</p>
<p>This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness</p>
<p>as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage. He had failed in his duties</p>
<p>to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.</p>
<p>He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.</p>
<p>All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone</p>
<p>really desirable.</p>
<p>“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy</p>
<p>landlord. But it is such an awkward size. It is too large for the</p>
<p>peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.”</p>
<p>Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or</p>
<p>despise Sir Harry for despising them. The latter impulse seemed the</p>
<p>more fruitful.</p>
<p>“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously. “It would be</p>
<p>a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.”</p>
<p>“Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly. “That is exactly what I fear, Mr.</p>
<p>Vyse. It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has</p>
<p>improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from</p>
<p>a station in these days of bicycles?”</p>
<p>“Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.</p>
<p>Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied</p>
<p>that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most</p>
<p>appalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless</p>
<p>neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.</p>
<p>“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea. How would you like</p>
<p>spinsters?”</p>
<p>“My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?”</p>
<p>“Yes; I met them abroad.”</p>
<p>“Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless. I heard from them</p>
<p>last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan. I’m really not joking.</p>
<p>They are quite the right people. Mr. Beebe knows them, too. May I tell</p>
<p>them to write to you?”</p>
<p>“Indeed you may!” he cried. “Here we are with the difficulty solved</p>
<p>already. How delightful it is! Extra facilities—please tell them they</p>
<p>shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees. Oh, the</p>
<p>agents! The appalling people they have sent me! One woman, when I</p>
<p>wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social</p>
<p>position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance. As if</p>
<p>one cares about that! And several references I took up were most</p>
<p>unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable. And oh, the</p>
<p>deceit! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. The</p>
<p>deceit of the most promising people. My dear Lucy, the deceit!”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with</p>
<p>Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all. I know the type. Preserve me</p>
<p>from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them</p>
<p>that make the house smell stuffy. It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather</p>
<p>let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has</p>
<p>come down.”</p>
<p>“I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very</p>
<p>sad thing.”</p>
<p>“The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.</p>
<p>“Yes, they are,” said Cecil. “I haven’t met them but I should say they</p>
<p>were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.”</p>
<p>“It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied. “I oughtn’t to come with my</p>
<p>troubles to young people. But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway</p>
<p>will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no</p>
<p>real help.”</p>
<p>“Then may I write to my Misses Alan?”</p>
<p>“Please!”</p>
<p>But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Beware! They are certain to have canaries. Sir Harry, beware of</p>
<p>canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then</p>
<p>the mice come. Beware of women altogether. Only let to a man.”</p>
<p>“Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her</p>
<p>remark.</p>
<p>“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups. If they get drunk, there’s an end of</p>
<p>them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off. If they’re vulgar,</p>
<p>they somehow keep it to themselves. It doesn’t spread so. Give me a</p>
<p>man—of course, provided he’s clean.”</p>
<p>Sir Harry blushed. Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments</p>
<p>to their sex. Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much</p>
<p>distinction. He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time,</p>
<p>should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself. She</p>
<p>was delighted. Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a</p>
<p>house. Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they</p>
<p>were on a small scale.</p>
<p>Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?”</p>
<p>“Certainly!” was her cordial reply.</p>
<p>Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them. He beamed</p>
<p>at them knowingly, said, “Aha! young people, young people!” and then</p>
<p>hastened to unlock the house.</p>
<p>“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of</p>
<p>earshot.</p>
<p>“Oh, Cecil!”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it. It would be wrong not to loathe that man.”</p>
<p>“He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.”</p>
<p>“No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life. In London he</p>
<p>would keep his place. He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife</p>
<p>would give brainless dinner parties. But down here he acts the little</p>
<p>god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and</p>
<p>every one—even your mother—is taken in.”</p>
<p>“All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt</p>
<p>discouraged. “I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.”</p>
<p>“It matters supremely. Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.</p>
<p>Oh, goodness, how cross I feel! How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar</p>
<p>tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.</p>
<p>_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! But let’s</p>
<p>forget him.”</p>
<p>This Lucy was glad enough to do. If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered</p>
<p>to her would escape? For instance, Freddy. Freddy was neither clever,</p>
<p>nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any</p>
<p>minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”? And what would she</p>
<p>reply? Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety</p>
<p>enough. She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some</p>
<p>time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,</p>
<p>during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.</p>
<p>“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.</p>
<p>Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them. Summer Street</p>
<p>lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged</p>
<p>from the highroad.</p>
<p>“Are there two ways?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, with that subdued</p>
<p>irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon. “Why is it,</p>
<p>Lucy, that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never</p>
<p>once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t I? The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but</p>
<p>pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave</p>
<p>her in doubt as to his meaning.</p>
<p>She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did</p>
<p>explain before they had gone a dozen yards.</p>
<p>“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with</p>
<p>me in a room.”</p>
<p>“A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.</p>
<p>“Yes. Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road. Never in the real</p>
<p>country like this.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean? I have never felt anything of the</p>
<p>sort. You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that you aren’t. I connect you with a view—a certain type</p>
<p>of view. Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?”</p>
<p>She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing:</p>
<p>“Do you know that you’re right? I do. I must be a poetess after all.</p>
<p>When I think of you it’s always as in a room. How funny!”</p>
<p>To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.</p>
<p>“A drawing-room, pray? With no view?”</p>
<p>“Yes, with no view, I fancy. Why not?”</p>
<p>“I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the</p>
<p>open air.”</p>
<p>She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?”</p>
<p>As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too</p>
<p>difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every</p>
<p>now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of</p>
<p>the trees. She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy</p>
<p>Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy</p>
<p>in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to</p>
<p>Italy, it had lost none of its charm.</p>
<p>Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny</p>
<p>green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.</p>
<p>She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!”</p>
<p>“Why do you call it that?”</p>
<p>“I can’t remember why. I suppose it comes out of some book. It’s only a</p>
<p>puddle now, but you see that stream going through it? Well, a good deal</p>
<p>of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and</p>
<p>the pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then Freddy used to bathe</p>
<p>there. He is very fond of it.”</p>
<p>“And you?”</p>
<p>He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed</p>
<p>here, too, till I was found out. Then there was a row.”</p>
<p>At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of</p>
<p>prudishness within him. But now? with his momentary cult of the fresh</p>
<p>air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity. He looked at her as</p>
<p>she stood by the pool’s edge. She was got up smart, as she phrased it,</p>
<p>and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its</p>
<p>own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.</p>
<p>“Who found you out?”</p>
<p>“Charlotte,” she murmured. “She was stopping with us.</p>
<p>Charlotte—Charlotte.”</p>
<p>“Poor girl!”</p>
<p>She smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had</p>
<p>shrunk, now appeared practical.</p>
<p>“Lucy!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.</p>
<p>“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.”</p>
<p>At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>“What, Cecil?”</p>
<p>“Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry</p>
<p>me—”</p>
<p>He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were</p>
<p>observed. His courage had gone.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Up to now I have never kissed you.”</p>
<p>She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.</p>
<p>“No—more you have,” she stammered.</p>
<p>“Then I ask you—may I now?”</p>
<p>“Of course, you may, Cecil. You might before. I can’t run at you, you</p>
<p>know.”</p>
<p>At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities. Her</p>
<p>reply was inadequate. She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.</p>
<p>As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil. As he</p>
<p>touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened</p>
<p>between them.</p>
<p>Such was the embrace. He considered, with truth, that it had been a</p>
<p>failure. Passion should believe itself irresistible. It should forget</p>
<p>civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined</p>
<p>nature. Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right</p>
<p>of way. Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young</p>
<p>man behind the counter would have done? He recast the scene. Lucy was</p>
<p>standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his</p>
<p>arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his</p>
<p>manliness. For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.</p>
<p>They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation. He waited for</p>
<p>her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts. At</p>
<p>last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.</p>
<p>“Emerson was the name, not Harris.”</p>
<p>“What name?”</p>
<p>“The old man’s.”</p>
<p>“What old man?”</p>
<p>“That old man I told you about. The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to.”</p>
<p>He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had</p>
<p>ever had.</p>
<p>Chapter X</p>
<p>Cecil as a Humourist</p>
<p>The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no</p>
<p>very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents</p>
<p>entitled her to. Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built</p>
<p>Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up,</p>
<p>and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there</p>
<p>himself. Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.</p>
<p>Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and</p>
<p>others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk</p>
<p>barrier of the downs. Most of these houses were larger than Windy</p>
<p>Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but</p>
<p>from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an</p>
<p>indigenous aristocracy. He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife</p>
<p>accepted the situation without either pride or humility. “I cannot</p>
<p>think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely</p>
<p>fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were</p>
<p>returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was</p>
<p>not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to</p>
<p>matter. When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few</p>
<p>honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best</p>
<p>society obtainable.</p>
<p>The best obtainable. Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull,</p>
<p>and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.</p>
<p>Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly</p>
<p>affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags,</p>
<p>orange-peel, and broken bottles. A Radical out and out, she learnt to</p>
<p>speak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she troubled to conceive</p>
<p>it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and</p>
<p>identical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside</p>
<p>it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the</p>
<p>London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in</p>
<p>the northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm</p>
<p>himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.</p>
<p>Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not</p>
<p>get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not</p>
<p>particularly high. You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s</p>
<p>olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you. She returned</p>
<p>with new eyes.</p>
<p>So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to</p>
<p>irritation. He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of</p>
<p>saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to</p>
<p>substitute for it the society he called broad. He did not realize that</p>
<p>Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities</p>
<p>that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its</p>
<p>defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he realize a</p>
<p>more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she</p>
<p>was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal</p>
<p>intercourse would alone satisfy her. A rebel she was, but not of the</p>
<p>kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but</p>
<p>equality beside the man she loved. For Italy was offering her the most</p>
<p>priceless of all possessions—her own soul.</p>
<p>Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged</p>
<p>thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in</p>
<p>striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net</p>
<p>and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.</p>
<p>The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of</p>
<p>mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.</p>
<p>“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing</p>
<p>what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.”</p>
<p>“But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe. “I wrote to Miss</p>
<p>Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called,</p>
<p>and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. They</p>
<p>are coming. I heard from them this morning.</p>
<p>“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried. “Just because</p>
<p>they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their</p>
<p>‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing. And poor Lucy—serve her</p>
<p>right—worn to a shadow.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the</p>
<p>tennis-court. Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he</p>
<p>was there.</p>
<p>“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a</p>
<p>tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. When in motion his orb was</p>
<p>encircled by a ring. “If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move</p>
<p>in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about</p>
<p>whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the</p>
<p>fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count. I told you not Saturn.”</p>
<p>“Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.</p>
<p>“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.”</p>
<p>“Saturn doesn’t bounce.”</p>
<p>“Saturn bounces enough.”</p>
<p>“No, he doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.”</p>
<p>“Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.</p>
<p>“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the</p>
<p>Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. That’s right,</p>
<p>Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over</p>
<p>the shins!”</p>
<p>Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria</p>
<p>Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.</p>
<p>Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to</p>
<p>fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a</p>
<p>well-mannered child into a howling wilderness. Up in the house Cecil</p>
<p>heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not</p>
<p>come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. He was not a coward and</p>
<p>bore necessary pain as well as any man. But he hated the physical</p>
<p>violence of the young. How right it was! Sure enough it ended in a cry.</p>
<p>“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as</p>
<p>Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her</p>
<p>feet by her brother.</p>
<p>“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.</p>
<p>“They have taken Cissie Villa.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t the name—”</p>
<p>Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the</p>
<p>grass. An interval elapses.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.</p>
<p>“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Freddy! You know nothing about it.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense yourself! I’ve this minute seen him. He said to me: ‘Ahem!</p>
<p>Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem! ahem! I have at</p>
<p>last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’</p>
<p>and slapped him on the back.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. The Miss Alans?”</p>
<p>“Rather not. More like Anderson.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch exclaimed. “Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right? I _said_</p>
<p>don’t interfere with Cissie Villa. I’m always right. I’m quite uneasy</p>
<p>at being always right so often.”</p>
<p>“It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s. Freddy doesn’t even know the</p>
<p>name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. I’ve got it. Emerson.”</p>
<p>“What name?”</p>
<p>“Emerson. I’ll bet you anything you like.”</p>
<p>“What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly. “I wish I had</p>
<p>never bothered over it at all.”</p>
<p>Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. Mr. Beebe,</p>
<p>whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was</p>
<p>the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch</p>
<p>from the contemplation of her own abilities.</p>
<p>“Emerson, Freddy? Do you know what Emersons they are?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was</p>
<p>democratic. Like his sister and like most young people, he was</p>
<p>naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact</p>
<p>that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.</p>
<p>“I trust they are the right sort of person. All right, Lucy”—she was</p>
<p>sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your</p>
<p>mother’s a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s</p>
<p>affectation to pretend there isn’t.”</p>
<p>“Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.</p>
<p>She was gazing sideways. Seated on a promontory herself, she could see</p>
<p>the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the</p>
<p>Weald. The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this</p>
<p>lateral view.</p>
<p>“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no</p>
<p>relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. Pray, does</p>
<p>that satisfy you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” he grumbled. “And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re</p>
<p>friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country</p>
<p>families will be able to call in perfect safety.”</p>
<p>“_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.</p>
<p>“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly. “Lucy, don’t screech.</p>
<p>It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.”</p>
<p>“But has Cecil—”</p>
<p>“Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.</p>
<p>Ahem! Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’”</p>
<p>She got up from the grass.</p>
<p>It was hard on Lucy. Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much. While</p>
<p>she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry</p>
<p>Otway, she had borne it like a good girl. She might well “screech” when</p>
<p>she heard that it came partly from her lover. Mr. Vyse was a</p>
<p>tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in</p>
<p>thwarting people. The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.</p>
<p>When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the</p>
<p>same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was</p>
<p>strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation</p>
<p>while she recovered her composure. He diverted it as follows:</p>
<p>“The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean? No, I don’t suppose it</p>
<p>will prove to be them. It is probably a long cry from them to friends</p>
<p>of Mr. Vyse’s. Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people! The queerest</p>
<p>people! For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.</p>
<p>“There was a great scene over some violets. They picked violets and</p>
<p>filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have</p>
<p>failed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so</p>
<p>pleased. It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories. ‘My dear</p>
<p>sister loves flowers,’ it began. They found the whole room a mass of</p>
<p>blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet</p>
<p>so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult. Yes, I always connect those</p>
<p>Florentine Emersons with violets.”</p>
<p>“Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his</p>
<p>sister’s face was very red. She could not recover herself. Mr. Beebe</p>
<p>saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.</p>
<p>“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a</p>
<p>goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very</p>
<p>immature—pessimism, et cetera. Our special joy was the father—such a</p>
<p>sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.”</p>
<p>In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip,</p>
<p>but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble. He repeated</p>
<p>any rubbish that came into his head.</p>
<p>“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “Lucy, don’t desert us—go</p>
<p>on playing bumble-puppy. Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been</p>
<p>the oddest place. That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being</p>
<p>there. Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop? By-the-by, we really must</p>
<p>ask Charlotte here some time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer. He suggested that his</p>
<p>hostess was mistaken. At the hint of opposition she warmed. She was</p>
<p>perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same</p>
<p>story had been told. The name escaped her. What was the name? Oh, what</p>
<p>was the name? She clasped her knees for the name. Something in</p>
<p>Thackeray. She struck her matronly forehead.</p>
<p>Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.</p>
<p>“I must go,” she said gravely. “Don’t be silly. You always overdo it</p>
<p>when you play.”</p>
<p>As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil</p>
<p>air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it</p>
<p>right. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made</p>
<p>her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of</p>
<p>nondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her naturally. She saw</p>
<p>that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely</p>
<p>truthful? Well, at all events, she must not tell lies. She hurried up</p>
<p>the garden, still flushed with shame. A word from Cecil would soothe</p>
<p>her, she was sure.</p>
<p>“Cecil!”</p>
<p>“Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed</p>
<p>in high spirits. “I was hoping you’d come. I heard you all</p>
<p>bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here. I, even I, have won a</p>
<p>great victory for the Comic Muse. George Meredith’s right—the cause of</p>
<p>Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have</p>
<p>found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa. Don’t be angry! Don’t</p>
<p>be angry! You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.”</p>
<p>He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled</p>
<p>her ridiculous forebodings at once.</p>
<p>“I have heard,” she said. “Freddy has told us. Naughty Cecil! I suppose</p>
<p>I must forgive you. Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!</p>
<p>Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have</p>
<p>nice friends of yours. But you oughtn’t to tease one so.”</p>
<p>“Friends of mine?” he laughed. “But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!</p>
<p>Come here.” But she remained standing where she was. “Do you know where</p>
<p>I met these desirable tenants? In the National Gallery, when I was up</p>
<p>to see my mother last week.”</p>
<p>“What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously. “I don’t quite</p>
<p>understand.”</p>
<p>“In the Umbrian Room. Absolute strangers. They were admiring Luca</p>
<p>Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly. However, we got talking, and they</p>
<p>refreshed me not a little. They had been to Italy.”</p>
<p>“But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.</p>
<p>“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country</p>
<p>cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends. I</p>
<p>thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their</p>
<p>address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual</p>
<p>blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—”</p>
<p>“Cecil! No, it’s not fair. I’ve probably met them before—”</p>
<p>He bore her down.</p>
<p>“Perfectly fair. Anything is fair that punishes a snob. That old man</p>
<p>will do the neighbourhood a world of good. Sir Harry is too disgusting</p>
<p>with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.</p>
<p>No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with</p>
<p>me. There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things. I believe in</p>
<p>democracy—”</p>
<p>“No, you don’t,” she snapped. “You don’t know what the word means.”</p>
<p>He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be</p>
<p>Leonardesque. “No, you don’t!”</p>
<p>Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.</p>
<p>“It isn’t fair, Cecil. I blame you—I blame you very much indeed. You</p>
<p>had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look</p>
<p>ridiculous. You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that</p>
<p>it is all at my expense? I consider it most disloyal of you.”</p>
<p>She left him.</p>
<p>“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.</p>
<p>No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness. As long as Lucy thought that</p>
<p>his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not</p>
<p>minded. He perceived that these new tenants might be of value</p>
<p>educationally. He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who</p>
<p>was silent. In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would</p>
<p>bring them to Windy Corner.</p>
<p>Chapter XI</p>
<p>In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat</p>
<p>The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not</p>
<p>disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse. His idea of bringing the Emersons</p>
<p>to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through</p>
<p>the negotiations without a hitch. Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement,</p>
<p>met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned. The Miss Alans were duly</p>
<p>offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held</p>
<p>responsible for the failure. Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the</p>
<p>new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as</p>
<p>soon as they arrived. Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that</p>
<p>she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his</p>
<p>head, to be forgotten, and to die.</p>
<p>Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows</p>
<p>because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but</p>
<p>settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.</p>
<p>Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and</p>
<p>were welcome into the neighbourhood. And Cecil was welcome to bring</p>
<p>whom he would into the neighbourhood. Therefore Cecil was welcome to</p>
<p>bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood. But, as I say, this took a</p>
<p>little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather</p>
<p>greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done. She was glad</p>
<p>that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie</p>
<p>Villa while she was safe in the London flat.</p>
<p>“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept</p>
<p>into his arms.</p>
<p>Cecil, too, became demonstrative. He saw that the needful fire had been</p>
<p>kindled in Lucy. At last she longed for attention, as a woman should,</p>
<p>and looked up to him because he was a man.</p>
<p>“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.</p>
<p>“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do! I don’t know what I should do without you.”</p>
<p>Several days passed. Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett. A</p>
<p>coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not</p>
<p>corresponded since they parted in August. The coolness dated from what</p>
<p>Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased</p>
<p>amazingly. For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval</p>
<p>world becomes exasperating in the classical. Charlotte, unselfish in</p>
<p>the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in</p>
<p>the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue</p>
<p>their tour. Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs. Vyse was an</p>
<p>acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned</p>
<p>suddenly. Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for</p>
<p>Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as</p>
<p>follows. It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.</p>
<p>“TUNBRIDGE WELLS,</p>
<p>“_September_.</p>
<p>“DEAREST LUCIA,</p>
<p>“I have news of you at last! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your</p>
<p>parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. Puncturing her</p>
<p>tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very</p>
<p>woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a</p>
<p>door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out. He said his</p>
<p>father had just taken the house. He _said_ he did not know that you</p>
<p>lived in the neighbourhood (?). He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup</p>
<p>of tea. Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean</p>
<p>breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who</p>
<p>will forbid him to enter the house, etc. That was a great misfortune,</p>
<p>and I dare say you have told them already. Mr. Vyse is so sensitive. I</p>
<p>remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome. I am very sorry about</p>
<p>it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.</p>
<p>“Believe me,</p>
<p>“Your anxious and loving cousin,</p>
<p>“CHARLOTTE.”</p>
<p>Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows:</p>
<p>“BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.</p>
<p>“DEAR CHARLOTTE,</p>
<p>“Many thanks for your warning. When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the</p>
<p>mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she</p>
<p>would blame you for not being always with me. I have kept that promise,</p>
<p>and cannot possibly tell her now. I have said both to her and Cecil</p>
<p>that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable</p>
<p>people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no</p>
<p>tea was probably that he had none himself. She should have tried at the</p>
<p>Rectory. I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage. You must see that</p>
<p>it would be too absurd. If the Emersons heard I had complained of them,</p>
<p>they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they</p>
<p>are not. I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.</p>
<p>As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for</p>
<p>myself. They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the</p>
<p>other day. We expect to be married in January.</p>
<p>“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy</p>
<p>Corner at all, but here. Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your</p>
<p>envelope again. No one opens my letters.</p>
<p>“Yours affectionately,</p>
<p>“L. M. HONEYCHURCH.”</p>
<p>Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we</p>
<p>cannot tell whether our secret is important or not. Were Lucy and her</p>
<p>cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if</p>
<p>he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at? Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett suggested the former. Perhaps she was right. It had become a</p>
<p>great thing now. Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and</p>
<p>her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.</p>
<p>“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago. She tried to</p>
<p>tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady</p>
<p>who had smitten his heart at school. But her body behaved so</p>
<p>ridiculously that she stopped.</p>
<p>She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis</p>
<p>visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on. It did her no</p>
<p>harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society</p>
<p>itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors. The weather was cool,</p>
<p>and it did her no harm. In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to</p>
<p>scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren</p>
<p>of famous people. The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness</p>
<p>that impressed the girl. One was tired of everything, it seemed. One</p>
<p>launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself</p>
<p>up amid sympathetic laughter. In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini</p>
<p>and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London</p>
<p>career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the</p>
<p>past.</p>
<p>The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.</p>
<p>She played Schumann. “Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the</p>
<p>querulous beauty of the music had died. She shook her head and played</p>
<p>Schumann again. The melody rose, unprofitably magical. It broke; it was</p>
<p>resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave. The</p>
<p>sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should</p>
<p>never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of</p>
<p>the audience throb. Not thus had she played on the little draped piano</p>
<p>at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.</p>
<p>When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up</p>
<p>and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s,</p>
<p>had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among</p>
<p>many people. The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had</p>
<p>seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her</p>
<p>abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he</p>
<p>was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.</p>
<p>“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end</p>
<p>of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.</p>
<p>“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.”</p>
<p>“Her music always was wonderful.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent</p>
<p>Honeychurches, but you know what I mean. She is not always quoting</p>
<p>servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.”</p>
<p>“Italy has done it.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy</p>
<p>to her. “It is just possible. Cecil, mind you marry her next January.</p>
<p>She is one of us already.”</p>
<p>“But her music!” he exclaimed. “The style of her! How she kept to</p>
<p>Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven. Schumann was right</p>
<p>for this evening. Schumann was the thing. Do you know, mother, I shall</p>
<p>have our children educated just like Lucy. Bring them up among honest</p>
<p>country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and</p>
<p>then—not till then—let them come to London. I don’t believe in these</p>
<p>London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one</p>
<p>himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.”</p>
<p>“Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.</p>
<p>As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s</p>
<p>room. Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought</p>
<p>it kind to go herself. She found the girl sitting upright with her hand</p>
<p>on her cheek.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.”</p>
<p>“Bad dreams?”</p>
<p>“Just dreams.”</p>
<p>The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You</p>
<p>should have heard us talking about you, dear. He admires you more than</p>
<p>ever. Dream of that.”</p>
<p>Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand. Mrs.</p>
<p>Vyse recessed to bed. Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.</p>
<p>Darkness enveloped the flat.</p>
<p>Chapter XII</p>
<p>Twelfth Chapter</p>
<p>It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains,</p>
<p>and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.</p>
<p>All that was gracious triumphed. As the motorcars passed through Summer</p>
<p>Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon</p>
<p>dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or</p>
<p>of the pines. Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over</p>
<p>his Rectory gate. Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.</p>
<p>“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.”</p>
<p>“M’m.”</p>
<p>“They might amuse you.”</p>
<p>Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new</p>
<p>people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just</p>
<p>moved in.</p>
<p>“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe. “They are worth</p>
<p>it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to</p>
<p>Cissie Villa. “Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through</p>
<p>which much squalor was visible.</p>
<p>A grave voice replied, “Hullo!”</p>
<p>“I’ve brought someone to see you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be down in a minute.”</p>
<p>The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed</p>
<p>to carry up the stairs. Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty. The</p>
<p>sitting-room itself was blocked with books.</p>
<p>“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered. “Are they that</p>
<p>sort?”</p>
<p>“I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment. What have they</p>
<p>got? Byron. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of</p>
<p>All Flesh. Never heard of it. Gibbon. Hullo! dear George reads German.</p>
<p>Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on. Well, I suppose your</p>
<p>generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.</p>
<p>On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this</p>
<p>inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.”</p>
<p>“I know. Isn’t it jolly? I like that. I’m certain that’s the old man’s</p>
<p>doing.”</p>
<p>“How very odd of him!”</p>
<p>“Surely you agree?”</p>
<p>But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on</p>
<p>spoiling the furniture.</p>
<p>“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.</p>
<p>“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.”</p>
<p>“The same as Lucy’s got.”</p>
<p>“Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?”</p>
<p>“She came back yesterday.”</p>
<p>“I suppose she had a good time?”</p>
<p>“Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book. “She and Cecil are thicker</p>
<p>than ever.”</p>
<p>“That’s good hearing.”</p>
<p>“I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.</p>
<p>“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different</p>
<p>now, mother thinks. She will read all kinds of books.”</p>
<p>“So will you.”</p>
<p>“Only medical books. Not books that you can talk about afterwards.</p>
<p>Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed. Cecil</p>
<p>says—”</p>
<p>“What on earth are those people doing upstairs? Emerson—we think we’ll</p>
<p>come another time.”</p>
<p>George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.</p>
<p>“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.”</p>
<p>Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. Perhaps he was</p>
<p>shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face</p>
<p>wanted washing. At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do? Come</p>
<p>and have a bathe.”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.</p>
<p>“‘How d’ye do? how d’ye do? Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.</p>
<p>“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard. But I’m afraid</p>
<p>it will only act between men. Can you picture a lady who has been</p>
<p>introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How</p>
<p>do you do? Come and have a bathe’? And yet you will tell me that the</p>
<p>sexes are equal.”</p>
<p>“I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly</p>
<p>descending the stairs. “Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe. I tell you they</p>
<p>shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.”</p>
<p>“We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.</p>
<p>“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you</p>
<p>place in the past, is really yet to come. We shall enter it when we no</p>
<p>longer despise our bodies.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.</p>
<p>“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead. We despise the body less</p>
<p>than women do. But not until we are comrades shall we enter the</p>
<p>garden.”</p>
<p>“I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass</p>
<p>of philosophy that was approaching him.</p>
<p>“I believed in a return to Nature once. But how can we return to Nature</p>
<p>when we have never been with her? To-day, I believe that we must</p>
<p>discover Nature. After many conquests we shall attain simplicity. It is</p>
<p>our heritage.”</p>
<p>“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at</p>
<p>Florence.”</p>
<p>“How do you do? Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George</p>
<p>for a bathe. Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.</p>
<p>Marriage is a duty. I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr.</p>
<p>Vyse, too. He has been most kind. He met us by chance in the National</p>
<p>Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house. Though I</p>
<p>hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway. I have met so few Liberal</p>
<p>landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game</p>
<p>laws with the Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to</p>
<p>bathe. Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!”</p>
<p>“Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy. “I must—that is to say, I have to—have the</p>
<p>pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.”</p>
<p>“_Call_, my lad? Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? Call on your</p>
<p>grandmother! Listen to the wind among the pines! Yours is a glorious</p>
<p>country.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return</p>
<p>our calls before ten days have elapsed. I trust that you have realized</p>
<p>about the ten days’ interval. It does not count that I helped you with</p>
<p>the stair-eyes yesterday. It does not count that they are going to</p>
<p>bathe this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, go and bathe, George. Why do you dawdle talking? Bring them back</p>
<p>to tea. Bring back some milk, cakes, honey. The change will do you</p>
<p>good. George has been working very hard at his office. I can’t believe</p>
<p>he’s well.”</p>
<p>George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of</p>
<p>one who has handled furniture.</p>
<p>“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him. “It is only a pond,</p>
<p>don’t you know. I dare say you are used to something better.”</p>
<p>“Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of</p>
<p>the house and into the pine-woods. How glorious it was! For a little</p>
<p>time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes</p>
<p>and philosophy. It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing</p>
<p>the bracken and the trees. Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who</p>
<p>could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition</p>
<p>looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a</p>
<p>word. He spoke of Florence. George attended gravely, assenting or</p>
<p>dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as</p>
<p>inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.</p>
<p>“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse! Did you realize</p>
<p>that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?”</p>
<p>“I did not. Miss Lavish told me.”</p>
<p>“When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of</p>
<p>Coincidence.’”</p>
<p>No enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we</p>
<p>suppose. For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here</p>
<p>now, when one comes to reflect.”</p>
<p>To his relief, George began to talk.</p>
<p>“It is. I have reflected. It is Fate. Everything is Fate. We are flung</p>
<p>together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart. The</p>
<p>twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—”</p>
<p>“You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman. “Let me give you</p>
<p>a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate. Don’t say, ‘I didn’t</p>
<p>do this,’ for you did it, ten to one. Now I’ll cross-question you.</p>
<p>Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?”</p>
<p>“Italy.”</p>
<p>“And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch?”</p>
<p>“National Gallery.”</p>
<p>“Looking at Italian art. There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence</p>
<p>and Fate. You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our</p>
<p>friends. This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.”</p>
<p>“It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George. “But you can call it</p>
<p>Italy if it makes you less unhappy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. But he</p>
<p>was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.</p>
<p>“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is</p>
<p>still to write.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that</p>
<p>you have come.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Here we are!” called Freddy.</p>
<p>“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.</p>
<p>“In there’s the pond. I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.</p>
<p>They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. There lay the pond,</p>
<p>set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain</p>
<p>the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. On account of the</p>
<p>rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like</p>
<p>a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.</p>
<p>“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe. “No</p>
<p>apologies are necessary for the pond.”</p>
<p>George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his</p>
<p>boots.</p>
<p>“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in</p>
<p>seed. What’s the name of this aromatic plant?”</p>
<p>No one knew, or seemed to care.</p>
<p>“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of</p>
<p>water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or</p>
<p>brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines. Very charming, very charming.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe thought he was not.</p>
<p>“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.</p>
<p>“Water’s water,” murmured George. Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of</p>
<p>apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were</p>
<p>a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. It was necessary to use his</p>
<p>muscles. It was necessary to keep clean. Mr. Beebe watched them, and</p>
<p>watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their</p>
<p>heads.</p>
<p>“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes</p>
<p>in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.</p>
<p>“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded</p>
<p>margin.</p>
<p>The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed</p>
<p>the question properly.</p>
<p>“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful,</p>
<p>water’s simply ripping.”</p>
<p>“Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and</p>
<p>sputtering at the sun.</p>
<p>“Water’s wonderful. Mr. Beebe, do.”</p>
<p>“Apooshoo, kouf.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible,</p>
<p>looked around him. He could detect no parishioners except the</p>
<p>pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other</p>
<p>against the blue. How glorious it was! The world of motor-cars and</p>
<p>rural Deans receded inimitably. Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these</p>
<p>things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the</p>
<p>intrusion of man?</p>
<p>“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little</p>
<p>pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.</p>
<p>It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy</p>
<p>said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. The three gentlemen</p>
<p>rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in</p>
<p>Götterdämmerung. But either because the rains had given a freshness or</p>
<p>because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of</p>
<p>the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for</p>
<p>some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and</p>
<p>Botany and Fate. They began to play. Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each</p>
<p>other. A little deferentially, they splashed George. He was quiet: they</p>
<p>feared they had offended him. Then all the forces of youth burst out.</p>
<p>He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked</p>
<p>them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.</p>
<p>“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the</p>
<p>sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to</p>
<p>bathe a second time. Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.</p>
<p>They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being</p>
<p>Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get</p>
<p>clean. And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the</p>
<p>sward, proclaiming:</p>
<p>“No. We are what matters. Without us shall no enterprise begin. To us</p>
<p>shall all flesh turn in the end.”</p>
<p>“A try! A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing</p>
<p>it beside an imaginary goal-post.</p>
<p>“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a</p>
<p>kick.</p>
<p>“Goal!”</p>
<p>“Goal!”</p>
<p>“Pass!”</p>
<p>“Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.</p>
<p>Clothes flew in all directions.</p>
<p>“Take care my hat! No, that’s enough, Freddy. Dress now. No, I say!”</p>
<p>But the two young men were delirious. Away they twinkled into the</p>
<p>trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a</p>
<p>wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.</p>
<p>“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in</p>
<p>his own parish. Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a</p>
<p>Rural Dean. “Hi! Steady on! I see people coming you fellows!”</p>
<p>Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.</p>
<p>“Hi! hi! _Ladies!_”</p>
<p>Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined. Still, they did not hear</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch,</p>
<p>Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.</p>
<p>Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some</p>
<p>bracken. George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down</p>
<p>the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.</p>
<p>“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. “Whoever were those</p>
<p>unfortunate people? Oh, dears, look away! And poor Mr. Beebe, too!</p>
<p>Whatever has happened?”</p>
<p>“Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he</p>
<p>must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though</p>
<p>he knew not against what. He led them now towards the bracken where</p>
<p>Freddy sat concealed.</p>
<p>“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path? Cecil,</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—”</p>
<p>No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol</p>
<p>and evidently “minded.”</p>
<p>“I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.”</p>
<p>“This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.”</p>
<p>They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant</p>
<p>expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.</p>
<p>“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared</p>
<p>a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds. “I</p>
<p>can’t be trodden on, can I?”</p>
<p>“Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you! What miserable management! Why</p>
<p>not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?”</p>
<p>“Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and</p>
<p>if another fellow—”</p>
<p>“Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to</p>
<p>argue. Come, Lucy.” They turned. “Oh, look—don’t look! Oh, poor Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe! How unfortunate again—”</p>
<p>For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface</p>
<p>garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary</p>
<p>George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.</p>
<p>“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken. “I’ve</p>
<p>swallowed a pollywog. It wriggleth in my tummy. I shall die—Emerson you</p>
<p>beast, you’ve got on my bags.”</p>
<p>“Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain</p>
<p>shocked. “And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. All these</p>
<p>colds come of not drying thoroughly.”</p>
<p>“Mother, do come away,” said Lucy. “Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.”</p>
<p>“Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.</p>
<p>He regarded himself as dressed. Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and</p>
<p>personable against the shadowy woods, he called:</p>
<p>“Hullo, Miss Honeychurch! Hullo!”</p>
<p>“Bow, Lucy; better bow. Whoever is it? I shall bow.”</p>
<p>Miss Honeychurch bowed.</p>
<p>That evening and all that night the water ran away. On the morrow the</p>
<p>pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory. It had been a call</p>
<p>to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose</p>
<p>influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for</p>
<p>youth.</p>
<p>Chapter XIII</p>
<p>How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome</p>
<p>How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview! But she had</p>
<p>always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which</p>
<p>surely we have a right to assume. Who could foretell that she and</p>
<p>George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of</p>
<p>coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? She</p>
<p>had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or</p>
<p>indifferent or furtively impudent. She was prepared for all of these.</p>
<p>But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with</p>
<p>the shout of the morning star.</p>
<p>Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she</p>
<p>reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree</p>
<p>of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the</p>
<p>scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the</p>
<p>stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too</p>
<p>much. “I will bow,” she had thought. “I will not shake hands with him.</p>
<p>That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom? To</p>
<p>gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across</p>
<p>the rubbish that cumbers the world.</p>
<p>So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil. It was</p>
<p>another of those dreadful engagement calls. Mrs. Butterworth had wanted</p>
<p>to see him, and he did not want to be seen. He did not want to hear</p>
<p>about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside. He did</p>
<p>not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and</p>
<p>made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done. Lucy</p>
<p>soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised</p>
<p>well for their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser</p>
<p>to discover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett, indeed,</p>
<p>though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains</p>
<p>nothing satisfactory. Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded</p>
<p>the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.</p>
<p>“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter</p>
<p>with Cecil?”</p>
<p>The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with</p>
<p>charity and restraint.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he’s tired.”</p>
<p>Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.</p>
<p>“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering</p>
<p>displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.”</p>
<p>“I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.”</p>
<p>“Cecil has told you to think so. You were devoted to her as a little</p>
<p>girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid</p>
<p>fever. No—it is just the same thing everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?”</p>
<p>“Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?”</p>
<p>“Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing</p>
<p>trouble ahead. “It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes</p>
<p>him sometimes seem—”</p>
<p>“Oh, rubbish! If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets</p>
<p>rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.</p>
<p>“Now, mother! I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!”</p>
<p>“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way.</p>
<p>No. It is the same with Cecil all over.”</p>
<p>“By-the-by—I never told you. I had a letter from Charlotte while I was</p>
<p>away in London.”</p>
<p>This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch resented it.</p>
<p>“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.</p>
<p>Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to</p>
<p>contradict me. No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor</p>
<p>intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture;</p>
<p>your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly</p>
<p>remember.”</p>
<p>“I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to. But he does</p>
<p>not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset</p>
<p>him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.”</p>
<p>“Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?”</p>
<p>“You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we</p>
<p>do.”</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t he leave the room? Why sit wriggling and sneering and</p>
<p>spoiling everyone’s pleasure?”</p>
<p>“We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy. Something had</p>
<p>enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so</p>
<p>perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form. The two</p>
<p>civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was</p>
<p>dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all</p>
<p>civilization had blinded her eyes. Good taste and bad taste were only</p>
<p>catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a</p>
<p>whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from</p>
<p>the comic song.</p>
<p>She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her</p>
<p>frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made</p>
<p>things no better. There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to</p>
<p>be supercilious, and he had succeeded. And Lucy—she knew not why—wished</p>
<p>that the trouble could have come at any other time.</p>
<p>“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.”</p>
<p>“All right, mother—”</p>
<p>“Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop. Go.”</p>
<p>She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window. It faced</p>
<p>north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky. Now, as in the</p>
<p>winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes. One connected the</p>
<p>landing window with depression. No definite problem menaced her, but</p>
<p>she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It</p>
<p>seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly. And she ought</p>
<p>not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter. She must be more careful;</p>
<p>her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was</p>
<p>about. Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding</p>
<p>upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.</p>
<p>“I say, those are topping people.”</p>
<p>“My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been! You have no business to take</p>
<p>them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public. It was all right</p>
<p>for you but most awkward for everyone else. Do be more careful. You</p>
<p>forget the place is growing half suburban.”</p>
<p>“I say, is anything on to-morrow week?”</p>
<p>“Not that I know of.”</p>
<p>“Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this</p>
<p>muddle.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with the court? They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve</p>
<p>ordered new balls.”</p>
<p>“I meant _it’s_ better not. I really mean it.”</p>
<p>He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the</p>
<p>passage. She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with</p>
<p>temper. Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they</p>
<p>impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans. Then Mrs. Honeychurch</p>
<p>opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making! I have</p>
<p>something to say to you. Did you say you had had a letter from</p>
<p>Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.</p>
<p>“Yes. I really can’t stop. I must dress too.”</p>
<p>“How’s Charlotte?”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>“Lucy!”</p>
<p>The unfortunate girl returned.</p>
<p>“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.</p>
<p>Did Charlotte mention her boiler?”</p>
<p>“Her _what?_”</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and</p>
<p>her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?”</p>
<p>“I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly. “I</p>
<p>shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out. She did not. She said: “Come</p>
<p>here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And,</p>
<p>though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and</p>
<p>Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.</p>
<p>So the grittiness went out of life. It generally did at Windy Corner.</p>
<p>At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one</p>
<p>member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil. Cecil despised</p>
<p>their methods—perhaps rightly. At all events, they were not his own.</p>
<p>Dinner was at half-past seven. Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew</p>
<p>up their heavy chairs and fell to. Fortunately, the men were hungry.</p>
<p>Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding. Then Freddy said:</p>
<p>“Lucy, what’s Emerson like?”</p>
<p>“I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a</p>
<p>reply.</p>
<p>“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?”</p>
<p>“Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.”</p>
<p>“He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.</p>
<p>Freddy looked at him doubtfully.</p>
<p>“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.</p>
<p>“Oh, very slightly. I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her</p>
<p>letter.”</p>
<p>“One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get</p>
<p>through the meal without a lie. “Among other things, that an awful</p>
<p>friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if</p>
<p>she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.”</p>
<p>“She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily. The remark was a happy one,</p>
<p>for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands</p>
<p>of females. She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those</p>
<p>women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek</p>
<p>notoriety by print. Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let</p>
<p>them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while</p>
<p>Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,”</p>
<p>with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s</p>
<p>wrath. But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to</p>
<p>gather in the darkness. There were too many ghosts about. The original</p>
<p>ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it</p>
<p>could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.</p>
<p>But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr. Harris, Miss Bartlett’s</p>
<p>letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was</p>
<p>bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes. It was Miss Bartlett who</p>
<p>returned now, and with appalling vividness.</p>
<p>“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s. How is</p>
<p>she?”</p>
<p>“I tore the thing up.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t she say how she was? How does she sound? Cheerful?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler. I know myself how water</p>
<p>preys upon one’s mind. I would rather anything else—even a misfortune</p>
<p>with the meat.”</p>
<p>Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.</p>
<p>“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the</p>
<p>spirit of her remark rather than the substance.</p>
<p>“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we</p>
<p>could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday</p>
<p>while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish. I have not seen poor</p>
<p>Charlotte for so long.”</p>
<p>It was more than her nerves could stand. And she could not protest</p>
<p>violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.</p>
<p>“Mother, no!” she pleaded. “It’s impossible. We can’t have Charlotte on</p>
<p>the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is. Freddy’s</p>
<p>got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take</p>
<p>in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare. It simply can’t be</p>
<p>done.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! It can.”</p>
<p>“If Minnie sleeps in the bath. Not otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Minnie can sleep with you.”</p>
<p>“I won’t have her.”</p>
<p>“Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.”</p>
<p>“Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again</p>
<p>laying his hand over his eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy. “I don’t want to make difficulties,</p>
<p>but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.”</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<p>“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. And no more does Cecil. She gets on our nerves. You</p>
<p>haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be,</p>
<p>though so good. So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but</p>
<p>spoil us by not asking her to come.”</p>
<p>“Hear, hear!” said Cecil.</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling</p>
<p>than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of</p>
<p>you two. You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of</p>
<p>beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and</p>
<p>plumbers. You are young, dears, and however clever young people are,</p>
<p>and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels</p>
<p>like to grow old.”</p>
<p>Cecil crumbled his bread.</p>
<p>“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on</p>
<p>my bike,” put in Freddy. “She thanked me for coming till I felt like</p>
<p>such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea</p>
<p>just right.”</p>
<p>“I know, dear. She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this</p>
<p>difficulty when we try to give her some little return.”</p>
<p>But Lucy hardened her heart. It was no good being kind to Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett. She had tried herself too often and too recently. One might</p>
<p>lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett nor any one else upon earth. She was reduced to saying: “I</p>
<p>can’t help it, mother. I don’t like Charlotte. I admit it’s horrid of</p>
<p>me.”</p>
<p>“From your own account, you told her as much.”</p>
<p>“Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly. She flurried—”</p>
<p>The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping</p>
<p>the places she had known as a child. The Sacred Lake would never be the</p>
<p>same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy</p>
<p>Corner. How would she fight against ghosts? For a moment the visible</p>
<p>world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.</p>
<p>“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said</p>
<p>Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the</p>
<p>admirable cooking.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because</p>
<p>in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I</p>
<p>don’t care for eggs. I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.”</p>
<p>Cecil frowned again. Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers,</p>
<p>hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact. “May me and Lucy</p>
<p>get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.</p>
<p>“We don’t want no dessert.”</p>
<p>Chapter XIV</p>
<p>How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely</p>
<p>Of course Miss Bartlett accepted. And, equally of course, she felt sure</p>
<p>that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior</p>
<p>spare room—something with no view, anything. Her love to Lucy. And,</p>
<p>equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday</p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only</p>
<p>faced the situation that encompassed her. She never gazed inwards. If</p>
<p>at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to</p>
<p>nerves. When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset</p>
<p>her nerves. Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might</p>
<p>upset her nerves. She was nervous at night. When she talked to</p>
<p>George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved</p>
<p>her deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she</p>
<p>really wished to remain near him! Of course, the wish was due to</p>
<p>nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us. Once she had</p>
<p>suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t</p>
<p>know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet</p>
<p>afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be</p>
<p>dismissed.</p>
<p>It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young</p>
<p>Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious. Life is</p>
<p>easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves”</p>
<p>or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire. She loved</p>
<p>Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the</p>
<p>phrases should have been reversed?</p>
<p>But the external situation—she will face that bravely.</p>
<p>The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough. Standing between</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy,</p>
<p>and George had replied. She was anxious to show that she was not shy,</p>
<p>and was glad that he did not seem shy either.</p>
<p>“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his</p>
<p>crudities in time. I rather mistrust young men who slip into life</p>
<p>gracefully.”</p>
<p>Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits. He laughs more.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied the clergyman. “He is waking up.”</p>
<p>That was all. But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and</p>
<p>she entertained an image that had physical beauty. In spite of the</p>
<p>clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival. She</p>
<p>was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch drove to meet her. She arrived at the London and Brighton</p>
<p>station, and had to hire a cab up. No one was at home except Freddy and</p>
<p>his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a</p>
<p>solid hour. Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with</p>
<p>little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper</p>
<p>lawn for tea.</p>
<p>“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising</p>
<p>from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain. “I</p>
<p>have upset everything. Bursting in on young people! But I insist on</p>
<p>paying for my cab up. Grant that, at any rate.”</p>
<p>“Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her</p>
<p>brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown</p>
<p>unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been</p>
<p>trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.”</p>
<p>“I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and</p>
<p>looked at her frayed glove.</p>
<p>“All right, if you’d really rather. Five shillings, and I gave a bob to</p>
<p>the driver.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett looked in her purse. Only sovereigns and pennies. Could</p>
<p>any one give her change? Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four</p>
<p>half-crowns. Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But</p>
<p>who am I to give the sovereign to?”</p>
<p>“Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.</p>
<p>“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not</p>
<p>hampered with me. We all have our little foibles, and mine is the</p>
<p>prompt settling of accounts.”</p>
<p>Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need</p>
<p>be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid. A</p>
<p>solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously</p>
<p>drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance,</p>
<p>and turned round.</p>
<p>But this did not do, either.</p>
<p>“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me</p>
<p>wretched. I should practically be robbing the one who lost.”</p>
<p>“Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil. “So it will work</p>
<p>out right if you give the pound to me.”</p>
<p>“Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously. “How is that, Mr.</p>
<p>Vyse?”</p>
<p>“Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab. Give me the pound, and</p>
<p>we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered</p>
<p>up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.</p>
<p>For a moment Cecil was happy. He was playing at nonsense among his</p>
<p>peers. Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had</p>
<p>marred the smiles. In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this</p>
<p>stupefying twaddle.</p>
<p>“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched</p>
<p>the iniquitous transaction. “I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the</p>
<p>quid.”</p>
<p>“Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t see—”</p>
<p>They tried to stifle her with cake.</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I’m done. I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me. Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me. Ow! What about Mr. Floyd’s ten</p>
<p>shillings? Ow! No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss</p>
<p>What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.”</p>
<p>“I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening. “Thank</p>
<p>you, dear, for reminding me. A shilling was it? Can any one give me</p>
<p>change for half a crown?”</p>
<p>“I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.</p>
<p>“Cecil, give me that sovereign. No, give me up that sovereign. I’ll get</p>
<p>Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the</p>
<p>beginning.”</p>
<p>“Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed</p>
<p>her across the lawn. Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity. When they</p>
<p>were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite</p>
<p>briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue</p>
<p>for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant. “Let me see—a</p>
<p>sovereign’s worth of silver.”</p>
<p>She escaped into the kitchen. Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were</p>
<p>too uncanny. It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke</p>
<p>or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had</p>
<p>been a ruse to surprise the soul.</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.</p>
<p>“I promised you I shouldn’t. Here is your money—all shillings, except</p>
<p>two half-crowns. Would you count it? You can settle your debt nicely</p>
<p>now.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St.</p>
<p>John ascending, which had been framed.</p>
<p>“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse</p>
<p>should come to hear of it from some other source.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle. “George</p>
<p>Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett considered. “For instance, the driver. I saw him looking</p>
<p>through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.”</p>
<p>Lucy shuddered a little. “We shall get the silly affair on our nerves</p>
<p>if we aren’t careful. How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold</p>
<p>of Cecil?”</p>
<p>“We must think of every possibility.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s all right.”</p>
<p>“Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows. In fact, he is certain to know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care if he does. I was grateful to you for your letter, but</p>
<p>even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at</p>
<p>it.”</p>
<p>“To contradict it?”</p>
<p>“No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not</p>
<p>trust him, for he desired her untouched.</p>
<p>“Very well, dear, you know best. Perhaps gentlemen are different to</p>
<p>what they were when I was young. Ladies are certainly different.”</p>
<p>“Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully. “You kind, anxious</p>
<p>thing. What _would_ you have me do? First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and</p>
<p>then you say, ‘Tell’. Which is it to be? Quick!”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest. I</p>
<p>blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able</p>
<p>to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am. You</p>
<p>will never forgive me.”</p>
<p>“Shall we go out, then. They will smash all the china if we don’t.”</p>
<p>For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with</p>
<p>a teaspoon.</p>
<p>“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again. Have</p>
<p>you seen the young one yet?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“We met at the Rectory.”</p>
<p>“What line is he taking up?”</p>
<p>“No line. He talked about Italy, like any other person. It is really</p>
<p>all right. What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it</p>
<p>bluntly? I do wish I could make you see it my way. He really won’t be</p>
<p>any nuisance, Charlotte.”</p>
<p>“Once a cad, always a cad. That is my poor opinion.”</p>
<p>Lucy paused. “Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that</p>
<p>there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She</p>
<p>paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.</p>
<p>Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a</p>
<p>novel. It was a new one from Smith’s library. Her mother must have</p>
<p>returned from the station.</p>
<p>“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head. I fell into</p>
<p>all those violets, and he was silly and surprised. I don’t think we</p>
<p>ought to blame him very much. It makes such a difference when you see a</p>
<p>person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. It really does;</p>
<p>it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t</p>
<p>admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. Freddy rather likes him,</p>
<p>and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself. He</p>
<p>has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into</p>
<p>tears. He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big</p>
<p>railways—not a porter! and runs down to his father for week-ends. Papa</p>
<p>was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired. There! Now</p>
<p>for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm. “Suppose we</p>
<p>don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more. We want you to</p>
<p>have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.”</p>
<p>Lucy thought this rather a good speech. The reader may have detected an</p>
<p>unfortunate slip in it. Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one</p>
<p>cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly</p>
<p>people. She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the</p>
<p>entrance of her hostess. Explanations took place, and in the midst of</p>
<p>them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her</p>
<p>brain.</p>
<p>Chapter XV</p>
<p>The Disaster Within</p>
<p>The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most</p>
<p>of the days of that year. In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up</p>
<p>the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of</p>
<p>mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the</p>
<p>heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves</p>
<p>unchangeable. Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in</p>
<p>either arose the tinkle of church bells.</p>
<p>The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which</p>
<p>lay sunning itself upon the gravel path. From the house came incoherent</p>
<p>sounds, as of females preparing for worship. “The men say they won’t</p>
<p>go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her,</p>
<p>no nonsense”—“Anne! Mary! Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I</p>
<p>trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she</p>
<p>at all events was one for church.</p>
<p>The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by</p>
<p>Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine. Its rays fell on the ladies</p>
<p>whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down</p>
<p>at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan;</p>
<p>on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete</p>
<p>the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned</p>
<p>previously. The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and</p>
<p>movement may engender shadow. But this book lies motionless, to be</p>
<p>caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly,</p>
<p>as though acknowledging the caress.</p>
<p>Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. Her new cerise</p>
<p>dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan. At her</p>
<p>throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an</p>
<p>engagement ring. Her eyes are bent to the Weald. She frowns a</p>
<p>little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not</p>
<p>to cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may</p>
<p>frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo</p>
<p>and the western hills.</p>
<p>“Lucy! Lucy! What’s that book? Who’s been taking a book out of the</p>
<p>shelf and leaving it about to spoil?”</p>
<p>“It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.”</p>
<p>“But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.”</p>
<p>Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a</p>
<p>Loggia. She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time</p>
<p>to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up. It was dreadful</p>
<p>how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like</p>
<p>the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it. Only this morning</p>
<p>she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and</p>
<p>Cecil had said, “What! you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And</p>
<p>this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view</p>
<p>and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely</p>
<p>conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.</p>
<p>“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?”</p>
<p>She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a</p>
<p>Sunday fluster.</p>
<p>“It’s a special collection—I forget what for. I do beg, no vulgar</p>
<p>clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice</p>
<p>bright sixpence. Where is the child? Minnie! That book’s all warped.</p>
<p>(Gracious, how plain you look!) Put it under the Atlas to press.</p>
<p>Minnie!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.</p>
<p>“Minnie, don’t be late. Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse,</p>
<p>never the carriage. “Where’s Charlotte? Run up and hurry her. Why is</p>
<p>she so long? She had nothing to do. She never brings anything but</p>
<p>blouses. Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses! Minnie!”</p>
<p>Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the</p>
<p>Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting. As usual, she didn’t see</p>
<p>why. Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men? The young</p>
<p>men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words. Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling</p>
<p>down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but</p>
<p>sovereigns and half crowns. Could any one give me—”</p>
<p>“Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious me, how smart you look! What a lovely</p>
<p>frock! You put us all to shame.”</p>
<p>“If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear</p>
<p>them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully. She got into the victoria and</p>
<p>placed herself with her back to the horse. The necessary roar ensued,</p>
<p>and then they drove off.</p>
<p>“Good-bye! Be good!” called out Cecil.</p>
<p>Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering. On the subject of “church</p>
<p>and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation. He had</p>
<p>said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to</p>
<p>overhaul herself; she did not know it was done. Honest orthodoxy Cecil</p>
<p>respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a</p>
<p>spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that</p>
<p>might grow heavenward like flowers. All that he said on this subject</p>
<p>pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the</p>
<p>Emersons were different.</p>
<p>She saw the Emersons after church. There was a line of carriages down</p>
<p>the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie</p>
<p>Villa. To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father</p>
<p>and son smoking in the garden.</p>
<p>“Introduce me,” said her mother. “Unless the young man considers that</p>
<p>he knows me already.”</p>
<p>He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them</p>
<p>formally. Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how</p>
<p>glad he was that she was going to be married. She said yes, she was</p>
<p>glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind</p>
<p>with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic,</p>
<p>and asked him how he liked his new house.</p>
<p>“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;</p>
<p>she had never known him offended before. He added: “We find, though,</p>
<p>that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.</p>
<p>Women mind such a thing. I am very much upset about it.”</p>
<p>“I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch</p>
<p>uneasily.</p>
<p>“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,”</p>
<p>said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. “He</p>
<p>thought we should be artistic. He is disappointed.”</p>
<p>“And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to</p>
<p>give it up. What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.</p>
<p>“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly. She must avoid</p>
<p>censuring Cecil. For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned,</p>
<p>though his name was never mentioned.</p>
<p>“So George says. He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall. Yet</p>
<p>it does seem so unkind.”</p>
<p>“There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George,</p>
<p>watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.</p>
<p>“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch. “That’s exactly what I say. Why all</p>
<p>this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?”</p>
<p>“There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain</p>
<p>amount of light,” he continued in measured tones. “We cast a shadow on</p>
<p>something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to</p>
<p>place to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place</p>
<p>where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very</p>
<p>much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!”</p>
<p>“Eh—?”</p>
<p>“I see you’re going to be clever. I hope you didn’t go behaving like</p>
<p>that to poor Freddy.”</p>
<p>George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would</p>
<p>get on rather well.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t,” he said. “He behaved that way to me. It is his</p>
<p>philosophy. Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of</p>
<p>Interrogation first.”</p>
<p>“What _do_ you mean? No, never mind what you mean. Don’t explain. He</p>
<p>looks forward to seeing you this afternoon. Do you play tennis? Do you</p>
<p>mind tennis on Sunday—?”</p>
<p>“George mind tennis on Sunday! George, after his education, distinguish</p>
<p>between Sunday—”</p>
<p>“Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday. No more do I. That’s</p>
<p>settled. Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so</p>
<p>pleased.”</p>
<p>He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter</p>
<p>about in these days.</p>
<p>She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the</p>
<p>Miss Alans.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck. The</p>
<p>kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came</p>
<p>out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the</p>
<p>morning sun? She remembered that in all his perversities he had never</p>
<p>spoken against affection.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett approached.</p>
<p>“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.</p>
<p>“You met her with my daughter in Florence.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of</p>
<p>the garden to meet the lady. Miss Bartlett promptly got into the</p>
<p>victoria. Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. It was the pension</p>
<p>Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.</p>
<p>It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.</p>
<p>George did not respond to the bow. Like any boy, he blushed and was</p>
<p>ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered. He said: “I—I’ll come up</p>
<p>to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house. Perhaps</p>
<p>anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went</p>
<p>straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as</p>
<p>clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and</p>
<p>need help. To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the</p>
<p>weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at</p>
<p>Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.</p>
<p>“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for</p>
<p>people if his son would talk to them. “George has been in such good</p>
<p>spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.”</p>
<p>Lucy caught her cousin’s eye. Something in its mute appeal made her</p>
<p>reckless. “Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then</p>
<p>she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I</p>
<p>knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence</p>
<p>escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had</p>
<p>sighted the ramparts of heaven. Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it</p>
<p>with disproportionate joy. All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a</p>
<p>tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the</p>
<p>melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things. It was</p>
<p>not an exploit. He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her</p>
<p>hand to her cheek. “He does not love me. No. How terrible if he did!</p>
<p>But he has not told. He will not tell.”</p>
<p>She longed to shout the words: “It is all right. It’s a secret between</p>
<p>us two for ever. Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at</p>
<p>Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room. The secret, big or</p>
<p>little, was guarded.</p>
<p>Only three English people knew of it in the world. Thus she interpreted</p>
<p>her joy. She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so</p>
<p>safe. As he helped her out of the carriage, she said:</p>
<p>“The Emersons have been so nice. George Emerson has improved</p>
<p>enormously.”</p>
<p>“How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them,</p>
<p>and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy</p>
<p>Corner for educational purposes.</p>
<p>“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship</p>
<p>which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He</p>
<p>had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.</p>
<p>“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are. George Emerson is</p>
<p>coming up this afternoon. He is a most interesting man to talk to. Only</p>
<p>don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing</p>
<p>for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to</p>
<p>her remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.</p>
<p>Lunch was a cheerful meal. Generally Lucy was depressed at meals. Some</p>
<p>one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not</p>
<p>visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will</p>
<p>not last, this cheerfulness. In January you must go to London to</p>
<p>entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she</p>
<p>had received a guarantee. Her mother would always sit there, her</p>
<p>brother here. The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning,</p>
<p>would never be hidden behind the western hills. After luncheon they</p>
<p>asked her to play. She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played</p>
<p>from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud</p>
<p>approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never</p>
<p>gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of</p>
<p>fairyland. Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to</p>
<p>get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play</p>
<p>us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.”</p>
<p>She closed the instrument.</p>
<p>“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.</p>
<p>Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round. There</p>
<p>George was. He had crept in without interrupting her.</p>
<p>“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without</p>
<p>a word of greeting, she reopened the piano. Cecil should have the</p>
<p>Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.</p>
<p>“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps</p>
<p>implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson. Lucy did not know</p>
<p>what to do nor even what she wanted to do. She played a few bars of the</p>
<p>Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.</p>
<p>“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.</p>
<p>“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. “I vote you</p>
<p>have a men’s four.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>“Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil. “I will not spoil the set.” He</p>
<p>never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to</p>
<p>make up a fourth.</p>
<p>“Oh, come along Cecil. I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s</p>
<p>Emerson.”</p>
<p>George corrected him: “I am not bad.”</p>
<p>One looked down one’s nose at this. “Then certainly I won’t play,” said</p>
<p>Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing</p>
<p>George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse. You had much better not</p>
<p>play. Much better not.”</p>
<p>Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she</p>
<p>would play. “I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?”</p>
<p>But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.</p>
<p>“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall</p>
<p>back on Lucy. There is no other way out of it. Lucy, go and change your</p>
<p>frock.”</p>
<p>Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. She kept it</p>
<p>without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in</p>
<p>the afternoon. As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was</p>
<p>sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything</p>
<p>up before she married him.</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd was her partner. She liked music, but how much better tennis</p>
<p>seemed. How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit</p>
<p>at the piano and feel girt under the arms. Once more music appeared to</p>
<p>her the employment of a child. George served, and surprised her by his</p>
<p>anxiety to win. She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at</p>
<p>Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that</p>
<p>obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to</p>
<p>her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win</p>
<p>at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had</p>
<p>begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.</p>
<p>Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked! The hills stood out above its</p>
<p>radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South</p>
<p>Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara. She might be</p>
<p>forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.</p>
<p>One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its</p>
<p>innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence. Ah,</p>
<p>how beautiful the Weald looked!</p>
<p>But now Cecil claimed her. He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood,</p>
<p>and would not sympathize with exaltation. He had been rather a nuisance</p>
<p>all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad</p>
<p>that he was obliged to read it aloud to others. He would stroll round</p>
<p>the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.</p>
<p>Three split infinitives.”</p>
<p>“Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke. When they had finished</p>
<p>their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and</p>
<p>really everyone must listen to it. Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to</p>
<p>hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.</p>
<p>“The scene is laid in Florence.”</p>
<p>“What fun, Cecil! Read away. Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your</p>
<p>energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point</p>
<p>of being pleasant to him.</p>
<p>He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are</p>
<p>you tired?”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m not!”</p>
<p>“Do you mind being beaten?”</p>
<p>She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so</p>
<p>she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a</p>
<p>splendid player, though. The light was behind you, and it was in my</p>
<p>eyes.”</p>
<p>“I never said I was.”</p>
<p>“Why, you did!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t attend.”</p>
<p>“You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house. We all</p>
<p>exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.”</p>
<p>“‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.</p>
<p>Lucy recollected herself.</p>
<p>“‘Sunset. Leonora was speeding—’”</p>
<p>Lucy interrupted. “Leonora? Is Leonora the heroine? Who’s the book by?”</p>
<p>“Joseph Emery Prank. ‘Sunset. Leonora speeding across the square. Pray</p>
<p>the saints she might not arrive too late. Sunset—the sunset of Italy.</p>
<p>Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it</p>
<p>now—’”</p>
<p>Lucy burst into laughter. “‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed! Why it’s Miss</p>
<p>Lavish! It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under</p>
<p>somebody else’s name.”</p>
<p>“Who may Miss Lavish be?”</p>
<p>“Oh, a dreadful person—Mr. Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?”</p>
<p>Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.</p>
<p>George looked up. “Of course I do. I saw her the day I arrived at</p>
<p>Summer Street. It was she who told me that you lived here.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent</p>
<p>down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean</p>
<p>something else. She watched his head, which was almost resting against</p>
<p>her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening. “No wonder the</p>
<p>novel’s bad,” she added. “I never liked Miss Lavish. But I suppose one</p>
<p>ought to read it as one’s met her.”</p>
<p>“All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her</p>
<p>inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature. “Every one writes</p>
<p>for money in these days.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Cecil—!”</p>
<p>“It is so. I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”</p>
<p>Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow. The ups and</p>
<p>downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her. She</p>
<p>had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer</p>
<p>to the clang of his. Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black</p>
<p>head again. She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting</p>
<p>to stroke it; the sensation was curious.</p>
<p>“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?”</p>
<p>“I never notice much difference in views.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Because they’re all alike. Because all that matters in them is</p>
<p>distance and air.”</p>
<p>“H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.</p>
<p>“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says</p>
<p>that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over</p>
<p>our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of</p>
<p>it.”</p>
<p>“I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering</p>
<p>the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.</p>
<p>“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees</p>
<p>and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human</p>
<p>crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural,</p>
<p>for the same reason.”</p>
<p>Lucy’s lips parted.</p>
<p>“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up. Something gets</p>
<p>added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those</p>
<p>hills.”</p>
<p>He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.</p>
<p>“What a splendid idea!” she murmured. “I shall enjoy hearing your</p>
<p>father talk again. I’m so sorry he’s not so well.”</p>
<p>“No, he isn’t well.”</p>
<p>“There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil. “Also</p>
<p>that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who</p>
<p>remember them, even in small rooms.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?”</p>
<p>“None. Why?”</p>
<p>“You spoke of ‘us.’”</p>
<p>“My mother, I was meaning.”</p>
<p>Cecil closed the novel with a bang.</p>
<p>“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!”</p>
<p>“I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”</p>
<p>“I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day</p>
<p>and seeing as far as Hindhead. It is the first thing that I remember.”</p>
<p>Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after</p>
<p>tennis—he didn’t do. He would have strolled away if Lucy had not</p>
<p>stopped him.</p>
<p>“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.”</p>
<p>“Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.”</p>
<p>“No—read away. I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read</p>
<p>out loud. If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.”</p>
<p>This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him. It put their visitor in</p>
<p>the position of a prig. Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book. Cecil</p>
<p>must have his reading and anything else that he liked. But her</p>
<p>attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had</p>
<p>been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as</p>
<p>far as Hindhead.</p>
<p>“Am I really to go?” asked George.</p>
<p>“No, of course not really,” she answered.</p>
<p>“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning. “Find me chapter two, if it isn’t</p>
<p>bothering you.”</p>
<p>Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.</p>
<p>She thought she had gone mad.</p>
<p>“Here—hand me the book.”</p>
<p>She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to</p>
<p>read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.”</p>
<p>He took the book from her.</p>
<p>“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone. Before her lay the rich</p>
<p>champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village. The</p>
<p>season was spring.’”</p>
<p>Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose,</p>
<p>for Cecil to read and for George to hear.</p>
<p>“‘A golden haze,’” he read. He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence,</p>
<p>while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets. All</p>
<p>unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’”</p>
<p>Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.</p>
<p>He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as</p>
<p>formal lovers use. No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the</p>
<p>lack of it. He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another</p>
<p>much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.</p>
<p>“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.</p>
<p>She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last. She</p>
<p>thought a disaster was averted. But when they entered the shrubbery it</p>
<p>came. The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been</p>
<p>forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved</p>
<p>passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.</p>
<p>“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.</p>
<p>As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they</p>
<p>reached the upper lawn alone.</p>
<p>Chapter XVI</p>
<p>Lying to George</p>
<p>But Lucy had developed since the spring. That is to say, she was now</p>
<p>better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the</p>
<p>world disapprove. Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by</p>
<p>deep sobs. She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I</p>
<p>must write some letters,” and went up to her room. Then she prepared</p>
<p>for action. Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our</p>
<p>hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we</p>
<p>shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must</p>
<p>stifle it.</p>
<p>She sent for Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>The contest lay not between love and duty. Perhaps there never is such</p>
<p>a contest. It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first</p>
<p>aim was to defeat herself. As her brain clouded over, as the memory of</p>
<p>the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to</p>
<p>her old shibboleth of nerves. She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering</p>
<p>with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been. Remembering</p>
<p>that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused</p>
<p>remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been</p>
<p>anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him. The</p>
<p>armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man</p>
<p>not only from others, but from his own soul. In a few moments Lucy was</p>
<p>equipped for battle.</p>
<p>“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin</p>
<p>arrived. “Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the</p>
<p>book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at</p>
<p>heart.</p>
<p>“There is a scene in it. The hero and heroine make love. Do you know</p>
<p>about that?”</p>
<p>“Dear—?”</p>
<p>“Do you know about it, please?” she repeated. “They are on a hillside,</p>
<p>and Florence is in the distance.”</p>
<p>“My good Lucia, I am all at sea. I know nothing about it whatever.”</p>
<p>“There are violets. I cannot believe it is a coincidence. Charlotte,</p>
<p>Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her? I have thought before</p>
<p>speaking; it _must_ be you.”</p>
<p>“Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.</p>
<p>“About that dreadful afternoon in February.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved. “Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t</p>
<p>put that in her book?”</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>“Not so that one could recognize it. Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”</p>
<p>“So you did tell?”</p>
<p>“I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of</p>
<p>conversation—”</p>
<p>“But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?</p>
<p>Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell</p>
<p>mother?”</p>
<p>“I will never forgive Eleanor. She has betrayed my confidence.”</p>
<p>“Why did you tell her, though? This is a most serious thing.”</p>
<p>Why does any one tell anything? The question is eternal, and it was not</p>
<p>surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response. She</p>
<p>had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done</p>
<p>harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.</p>
<p>Lucy stamped with irritation.</p>
<p>“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson;</p>
<p>it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again. Behind Cecil’s back.</p>
<p>Ugh! Is it possible that men are such brutes? Behind Cecil’s back as we</p>
<p>were walking up the garden.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.</p>
<p>“What is to be done now? Can you tell me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day. Fancy if</p>
<p>your prospects—”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word. “I see now why you wanted me</p>
<p>to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that</p>
<p>you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.”</p>
<p>It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince. “However,” said the girl,</p>
<p>despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done. You have put me</p>
<p>in a most awkward position. How am I to get out of it?”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett could not think. The days of her energy were over. She</p>
<p>was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that. She</p>
<p>stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the</p>
<p>necessary rage.</p>
<p>“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.</p>
<p>And who’s to give it him? I can’t tell mother now—owing to you. Nor</p>
<p>Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you. I am caught up every way. I think I</p>
<p>shall go mad. I have no one to help me. That’s why I’ve sent for you.</p>
<p>What’s wanted is a man with a whip.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.</p>
<p>“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing. What’s to be _done?_ We women go</p>
<p>maundering on. What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?”</p>
<p>“I always said he was a cad, dear. Give me credit for that, at all</p>
<p>events. From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a</p>
<p>bath.”</p>
<p>“Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong! We’ve both made a</p>
<p>muddle of it. George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he</p>
<p>to be left unpunished, or isn’t he? I want to know.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless. Her own exposure had unnerved</p>
<p>her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain. She moved</p>
<p>feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels</p>
<p>among the laurels.</p>
<p>“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.</p>
<p>Can’t you speak again to him now?”</p>
<p>“Willingly would I move heaven and earth—”</p>
<p>“I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously. “Will you</p>
<p>speak to him? It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all</p>
<p>happened because you broke your word.”</p>
<p>“Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”</p>
<p>Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.</p>
<p>“Yes or no, please; yes or no.”</p>
<p>“It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George</p>
<p>Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture. “No one will help me. I</p>
<p>will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was</p>
<p>what her cousin had intended all along.</p>
<p>“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below. “Found the lost ball? Good</p>
<p>man! Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the</p>
<p>terrace.</p>
<p>“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you! I admire you—”</p>
<p>They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the</p>
<p>rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning</p>
<p>to cumber her soul. Her anger faded at the sight of him. Ah! The</p>
<p>Emersons were fine people in their way. She had to subdue a rush in her</p>
<p>blood before saying:</p>
<p>“Freddy has taken him into the dining-room. The others are going down</p>
<p>the garden. Come. Let us get this over quickly. Come. I want you in the</p>
<p>room, of course.”</p>
<p>“Lucy, do you mind doing it?”</p>
<p>“How can you ask such a ridiculous question?”</p>
<p>“Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand. “I seem to bring nothing but</p>
<p>misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded. She remembered their last</p>
<p>evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett’s toque on the door. She was not to be trapped by pathos a</p>
<p>second time. Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.</p>
<p>“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying. “The jam’s jolly good.”</p>
<p>George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the</p>
<p>dining-room. As she entered he stopped, and said:</p>
<p>“No—nothing to eat.”</p>
<p>“You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr.</p>
<p>Emerson all he wants. Where’s mother?”</p>
<p>“She’s started on her Sunday writing. She’s in the drawing-room.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right. You go away.”</p>
<p>He went off singing.</p>
<p>Lucy sat down at the table. Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly</p>
<p>frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.</p>
<p>She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech. She just said: “I</p>
<p>can’t have it, Mr. Emerson. I cannot even talk to you. Go out of this</p>
<p>house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing</p>
<p>as she spoke and pointing to the door. “I hate a row. Go please.”</p>
<p>“What—”</p>
<p>“No discussion.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t—”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Go, please. I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t</p>
<p>mean that you are going to marry that man?”</p>
<p>The line was unexpected.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her. “You are</p>
<p>merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse. He’s</p>
<p>only for an acquaintance. He is for society and cultivated talk. He</p>
<p>should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.”</p>
<p>It was a new light on Cecil’s character.</p>
<p>“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?”</p>
<p>“I can scarcely discuss—”</p>
<p>“No, but have you ever? He is the sort who are all right so long as</p>
<p>they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now. It’s</p>
<p>shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny</p>
<p>himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a</p>
<p>different person. I would never have let myself go. But I saw him first</p>
<p>in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced</p>
<p>the names of great painters. Then he brings us here, and we find it is</p>
<p>to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour. That is the man all</p>
<p>over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he</p>
<p>can find. Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and</p>
<p>teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to</p>
<p>settle whether you were shocked or no. Cecil all over again. He daren’t</p>
<p>let a woman decide. He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand</p>
<p>years. Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s</p>
<p>charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly;</p>
<p>and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.</p>
<p>So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the</p>
<p>whole of this afternoon. Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’</p>
<p>because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more</p>
<p>self-control. I’m not ashamed. I don’t apologize. But it has frightened</p>
<p>you, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have</p>
<p>told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But</p>
<p>therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.”</p>
<p>Lucy thought of a very good remark.</p>
<p>“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson. Pardon me for</p>
<p>suggesting that you have caught the habit.”</p>
<p>And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality. He</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>“Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary. “I’m the same kind</p>
<p>of brute at bottom. This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep,</p>
<p>and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the</p>
<p>garden. But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He</p>
<p>thought. “Yes—really in a better way. I want you to have your own</p>
<p>thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards</p>
<p>her. “Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as</p>
<p>you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain. I</p>
<p>have cared for you since that man died. I cannot live without you, ‘No</p>
<p>good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again</p>
<p>when all the world is glorious water and sun. As you came through the</p>
<p>wood I saw that nothing else mattered. I called. I wanted to live and</p>
<p>have my chance of joy.”</p>
<p>“And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm. “Does he not</p>
<p>matter? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly? A detail of no</p>
<p>importance, I suppose?”</p>
<p>But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.</p>
<p>“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?”</p>
<p>He said: “It is our last chance. I shall do all that I can.” And as if</p>
<p>he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some</p>
<p>portent against the skies of the evening. “You wouldn’t stop us this</p>
<p>second time if you understood,” he said. “I have been into the dark,</p>
<p>and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.”</p>
<p>Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though</p>
<p>demolishing some invisible obstacle. She did not answer.</p>
<p>“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the</p>
<p>floor and preparing to go. “It is being certain that Lucy cares for me</p>
<p>really. It is that love and youth matter intellectually.”</p>
<p>In silence the two women watched him. His last remark, they knew, was</p>
<p>nonsense, but was he going after it or not? Would not he, the cad, the</p>
<p>charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish? No. He was apparently</p>
<p>content. He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they</p>
<p>looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin</p>
<p>to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues</p>
<p>were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.</p>
<p>“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!”</p>
<p>Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet. “Well, he amuses me,” she said.</p>
<p>“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the</p>
<p>latter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I</p>
<p>think, though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me</p>
<p>again.”</p>
<p>And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish:</p>
<p>“Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is</p>
<p>it? Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really. It might have been very serious.</p>
<p>But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go down to them.”</p>
<p>But, once in the open air, she paused. Some emotion—pity, terror, love,</p>
<p>but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.</p>
<p>Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the</p>
<p>more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. That something</p>
<p>or other mattered intellectually? A leaf, violently agitated, danced</p>
<p>past her, while other leaves lay motionless. That the earth was</p>
<p>hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over</p>
<p>Windy Corner?</p>
<p>“Hullo, Lucy! There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll</p>
<p>hurry.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson has had to go.”</p>
<p>“What a nuisance! That spoils the four. I say, Cecil, do play, do,</p>
<p>there’s a good chap. It’s Floyd’s last day. Do play tennis with us,</p>
<p>just this once.”</p>
<p>Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete. As you well</p>
<p>remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for</p>
<p>anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not</p>
<p>inflict myself on you.”</p>
<p>The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes. How had she stood Cecil for a moment?</p>
<p>He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her</p>
<p>engagement.</p>
<p>Chapter XVII</p>
<p>Lying to Cecil</p>
<p>He was bewildered. He had nothing to say. He was not even angry, but</p>
<p>stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what</p>
<p>had led her to such a conclusion.</p>
<p>She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their</p>
<p>bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men. Freddy and Mr.</p>
<p>Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably</p>
<p>lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.</p>
<p>“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things</p>
<p>over. We are too different. I must ask you to release me, and try to</p>
<p>forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.”</p>
<p>It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her</p>
<p>voice showed it.</p>
<p>“Different—how—how—”</p>
<p>“I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued,</p>
<p>still on her knees by the sideboard. “My Italian trip came too late,</p>
<p>and I am forgetting all that I learnt there. I shall never be able to</p>
<p>talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand you. You aren’t like yourself. You’re tired, Lucy.”</p>
<p>“Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once. “That is exactly like you. You</p>
<p>always think women don’t mean what they say.”</p>
<p>“Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.”</p>
<p>“What if I do? It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth. I can’t</p>
<p>marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.”</p>
<p>“You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed</p>
<p>indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches. But give me a</p>
<p>moment’s time.” He closed his eyes. “You must excuse me if I say stupid</p>
<p>things, but my brain has gone to pieces. Part of it lives three minutes</p>
<p>back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it</p>
<p>difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.”</p>
<p>It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation</p>
<p>increased. She again desired a struggle, not a discussion. To bring on</p>
<p>the crisis, she said:</p>
<p>“There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them. Things</p>
<p>must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.</p>
<p>If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to</p>
<p>you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.”</p>
<p>“I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never</p>
<p>could play. I don’t understand a word you say.”</p>
<p>“You can play well enough to make up a four. I thought it abominably</p>
<p>selfish of you.”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis. Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you</p>
<p>have warned me if you felt anything wrong? You talked of our wedding at</p>
<p>lunch—at least, you let me talk.”</p>
<p>“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly. “I might</p>
<p>have known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of</p>
<p>course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have</p>
<p>been feeling for weeks. Surely it was better not to speak until I felt</p>
<p>certain.” She developed this position. “Often before I have wondered if</p>
<p>I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted</p>
<p>to be my husband? I don’t think so. You don’t like Freddy, nor my</p>
<p>mother. There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all</p>
<p>our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good</p>
<p>mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point. They have</p>
<p>to-day. I see clearly. I must speak. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently. “I cannot tell why,</p>
<p>but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not</p>
<p>treating me fairly. It’s all too horrible.”</p>
<p>“What’s the good of a scene?”</p>
<p>“No good. But surely I have a right to hear a little more.”</p>
<p>He put down his glass and opened the window. From where she knelt,</p>
<p>jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into</p>
<p>it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful</p>
<p>face.</p>
<p>“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy</p>
<p>or any one might be outside.” He obeyed. “I really think we had better</p>
<p>go to bed, if you don’t mind. I shall only say things that will make me</p>
<p>unhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no</p>
<p>good talking.”</p>
<p>But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment</p>
<p>more desirable. He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first</p>
<p>time since they were engaged. From a Leonardo she had become a living</p>
<p>woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even</p>
<p>eluded art. His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of</p>
<p>genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved</p>
<p>me!”</p>
<p>“I did not,” she said. “I thought I did at first. I am sorry, and ought</p>
<p>to have refused you this last time, too.”</p>
<p>He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed</p>
<p>at his dignified behaviour. She had counted on his being petty. It</p>
<p>would have made things easier for her. By a cruel irony she was drawing</p>
<p>out all that was finest in his disposition.</p>
<p>“You don’t love me, evidently. I dare say you are right not to. But it</p>
<p>would hurt a little less if I knew why.”</p>
<p>“Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort</p>
<p>who can’t know any one intimately.”</p>
<p>A horrified look came into his eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean exactly that. But you will question me, though I beg you</p>
<p>not to, and I must say something. It is that, more or less. When we</p>
<p>were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always</p>
<p>protecting me.” Her voice swelled. “I won’t be protected. I will choose</p>
<p>for myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can’t</p>
<p>I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through</p>
<p>you? A woman’s place! You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s</p>
<p>conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to</p>
<p>her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand</p>
<p>beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap</p>
<p>yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me. I</p>
<p>won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more</p>
<p>glorious, and you hide them from me. That’s why I break off my</p>
<p>engagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when</p>
<p>you came to people—” She stopped.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then Cecil said with great emotion:</p>
<p>“It is true.”</p>
<p>“True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.</p>
<p>“True, every word. It is a revelation. It is—I.”</p>
<p>“Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.”</p>
<p>He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true. I</p>
<p>fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged. I behaved like a cad</p>
<p>to Beebe and to your brother. You are even greater than I thought.” She</p>
<p>withdrew a step. “I’m not going to worry you. You are far too good to</p>
<p>me. I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for</p>
<p>this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you</p>
<p>wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve. I have</p>
<p>never known you till this evening. I have just used you as a peg for my</p>
<p>silly notions of what a woman should be. But this evening you are a</p>
<p>different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with</p>
<p>incontrollable anger.</p>
<p>“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.</p>
<p>Then she lost her balance. She cried: “If you think I am in love with</p>
<p>some one else, you are very much mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Of course I don’t think that. You are not that kind, Lucy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, you do think it. It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept</p>
<p>Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men. If a</p>
<p>girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone</p>
<p>else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting,</p>
<p>brutal! As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.”</p>
<p>He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past. I shall</p>
<p>never say it again. You have taught me better.”</p>
<p>She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.</p>
<p>“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no</p>
<p>‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity. I beg your pardon most humbly</p>
<p>if my words suggested that there was. I only meant that there was a</p>
<p>force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.”</p>
<p>“All right, Cecil, that will do. Don’t apologize to me. It was my</p>
<p>mistake.”</p>
<p>“It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals,</p>
<p>and yours are the nobler. I was bound up in the old vicious notions,</p>
<p>and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke. “I must</p>
<p>actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really</p>
<p>am. Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman. Will you shake</p>
<p>hands?”</p>
<p>“Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the</p>
<p>curtains. “Good-night, Cecil. Good-bye. That’s all right. I’m sorry</p>
<p>about it. Thank you very much for your gentleness.”</p>
<p>“Let me light your candle, shall I?”</p>
<p>They went into the hall.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Good-night again. God bless you, Lucy!”</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Cecil.”</p>
<p>She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters</p>
<p>passed over her face like the beat of wings. On the landing he paused</p>
<p>strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.</p>
<p>For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his</p>
<p>love became him like the leaving of it.</p>
<p>She could never marry. In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.</p>
<p>Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself. She must</p>
<p>be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for</p>
<p>liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that</p>
<p>George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable</p>
<p>release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.</p>
<p>She put out the lamp.</p>
<p>It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel. She gave</p>
<p>up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the</p>
<p>benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to</p>
<p>their destiny by catch-words. The armies are full of pleasant and pious</p>
<p>folk. But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy</p>
<p>within. They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be</p>
<p>their strife after virtue. As the years pass, they are censured. Their</p>
<p>pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism,</p>
<p>their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort</p>
<p>wherever they go. They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas</p>
<p>Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary</p>
<p>course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.</p>
<p>Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not</p>
<p>love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one. The night</p>
<p>received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.</p>
<p>Chapter XVIII</p>
<p>Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants</p>
<p>Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred</p>
<p>feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great</p>
<p>buttresses that supported the hill. On either side of it was a shallow</p>
<p>ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the</p>
<p>left ran the highway into the Weald.</p>
<p>Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble</p>
<p>dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy</p>
<p>Corner,—he laughed. The situation was so glorious, the house so</p>
<p>commonplace, not to say impertinent. The late Mr. Honeychurch had</p>
<p>affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his</p>
<p>money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret,</p>
<p>shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and</p>
<p>watch the carts going up and down the road. So impertinent—and yet the</p>
<p>house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings</p>
<p>honestly. Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive</p>
<p>architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all</p>
<p>these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner</p>
<p>seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation. One might</p>
<p>laugh at the house, but one never shuddered. Mr. Beebe was bicycling</p>
<p>over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. He had heard from</p>
<p>the Miss Alans. These admirable ladies, since they could not go to</p>
<p>Cissie Villa, had changed their plans. They were going to Greece</p>
<p>instead.</p>
<p>“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine,</p>
<p>“we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter. Of course,</p>
<p>Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive</p>
<p>bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting</p>
<p>first into a steamer and then into a train. But is there an English</p>
<p>Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go</p>
<p>any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable</p>
<p>pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.”</p>
<p>Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe</p>
<p>greeted Windy Corner was partly for her. She would see the fun of it,</p>
<p>and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty. Though she was</p>
<p>hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that</p>
<p>cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or</p>
<p>she could not play the piano as she did. He had a theory that musicians</p>
<p>are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they</p>
<p>want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their</p>
<p>friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet</p>
<p>been understood. This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been</p>
<p>illustrated by facts. Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only</p>
<p>riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether</p>
<p>Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies</p>
<p>to visit Athens.</p>
<p>A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught</p>
<p>sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped</p>
<p>abruptly when it reached the main road. Therefore it must be the horse,</p>
<p>who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.</p>
<p>The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe</p>
<p>recognized as Cecil and Freddy. They were an odd couple to go driving;</p>
<p>but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs. Cecil, who wore a</p>
<p>bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the</p>
<p>station. They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the</p>
<p>summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.</p>
<p>They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.</p>
<p>“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.</p>
<p>Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.</p>
<p>“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of</p>
<p>Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it. “Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it</p>
<p>romance? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople. They are taken</p>
<p>in a snare that cannot fail. They will end by going round the world.”</p>
<p>Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused</p>
<p>and interested.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Romance capricious! I never notice it in you young people; you</p>
<p>do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while</p>
<p>the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against</p>
<p>the terrible thing. ‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’</p>
<p>So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension</p>
<p>with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland</p>
<p>forlorn! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans. They want the</p>
<p>Pension Keats.”</p>
<p>“I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you</p>
<p>any matches?”</p>
<p>“I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he</p>
<p>spoke to the boy more kindly.</p>
<p>“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit. I haven’t been to</p>
<p>Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my</p>
<p>friends going. It is altogether too big for our little lot. Don’t you</p>
<p>think so? Italy is just about as much as we can manage. Italy is</p>
<p>heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in</p>
<p>either case absolutely out of our suburban focus. All right, Freddy—I</p>
<p>am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another</p>
<p>fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a</p>
<p>cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men. “I was saying, if</p>
<p>our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be</p>
<p>Italian. Big enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine</p>
<p>Chapel for me. There the contrast is just as much as I can realize. But</p>
<p>not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here</p>
<p>comes the victoria.”</p>
<p>“You’re quite right,” said Cecil. “Greece is not for our little lot”;</p>
<p>and he got in. Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he</p>
<p>trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really. And before they had gone a</p>
<p>dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box,</p>
<p>which had not been returned. As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you</p>
<p>only talked about books. Cecil’s hard hit. Lucy won’t marry him. If</p>
<p>you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken</p>
<p>down.”</p>
<p>“But when—”</p>
<p>“Late last night. I must go.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps they won’t want me down there.”</p>
<p>“No—go on. Good-bye.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle</p>
<p>of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.</p>
<p>Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he</p>
<p>negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart. The house was</p>
<p>again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.</p>
<p>He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata. He hesitated</p>
<p>a moment, but went down the garden as requested. There he found a</p>
<p>mournful company. It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and</p>
<p>broken the dahlias. Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them</p>
<p>up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of</p>
<p>assistance. At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a</p>
<p>minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.</p>
<p>“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe? Gracious what a mess everything is! Look</p>
<p>at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the</p>
<p>ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage</p>
<p>having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give</p>
<p>everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.”</p>
<p>Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.</p>
<p>“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though</p>
<p>conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn</p>
<p>gales.</p>
<p>“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. The garden-child, who</p>
<p>did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.</p>
<p>Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very</p>
<p>disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings</p>
<p>would tear longways instead of across.</p>
<p>“Come for a walk with me,” he told her. “You have worried them as much</p>
<p>as they can stand. Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly. I</p>
<p>shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.”</p>
<p>“Oh, must you? Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when</p>
<p>both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange</p>
<p>cactus will go before I can get to it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.</p>
<p>“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about</p>
<p>for, either in the house or out of it.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she</p>
<p>had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round</p>
<p>and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance. As they walked up the garden,</p>
<p>the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the</p>
<p>garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth</p>
<p>of blossom.</p>
<p>“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.</p>
<p>“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a</p>
<p>moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother. Or will</p>
<p>she come with us?”</p>
<p>“I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.”</p>
<p>“They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for</p>
<p>breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has</p>
<p>gone, and Freddy won’t play with me. In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house</p>
<p>is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur. “Go and put on your boots.”</p>
<p>He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively</p>
<p>pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart. She stopped when he entered.</p>
<p>“How do you do? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at</p>
<p>the Beehive. Would you come too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I will, thank you.”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.”</p>
<p>Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.</p>
<p>“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom</p>
<p>of his heart, he thought them silly little things.</p>
<p>Lucy passed into Schumann.</p>
<p>“Miss Honeychurch!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I met them on the hill. Your brother told me.”</p>
<p>“Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed. Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had</p>
<p>thought that she would like him to be told.</p>
<p>“I needn’t say that it will go no further.”</p>
<p>“Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for</p>
<p>each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.</p>
<p>“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you</p>
<p>have done the right thing.”</p>
<p>“So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.”</p>
<p>“I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.”</p>
<p>“So does mother. Mother minds dreadfully.”</p>
<p>“I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as</p>
<p>much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. It was really</p>
<p>a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not</p>
<p>herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.</p>
<p>“And Freddy minds.”</p>
<p>“Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he? I gathered that</p>
<p>he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.”</p>
<p>“Boys are so odd.”</p>
<p>Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor. Tea</p>
<p>at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action,</p>
<p>so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an</p>
<p>absurd letter from Miss Alan. That was really what brought me over. I</p>
<p>thought it might amuse you all.”</p>
<p>“How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.</p>
<p>For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter. After</p>
<p>a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with</p>
<p>“Going abroad? When do they start?”</p>
<p>“Next week, I gather.”</p>
<p>“Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?”</p>
<p>“No, he didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.”</p>
<p>So she did want to talk about her broken engagement. Always</p>
<p>complaisant, he put the letter away. But she, at once exclaimed in a</p>
<p>high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans! How perfectly</p>
<p>splendid of them to go abroad!”</p>
<p>“I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the</p>
<p>Illyrian coast!”</p>
<p>She laughed heartily. “Oh, delightful! I wish they’d take me.”</p>
<p>“Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel? Perhaps George Emerson</p>
<p>is right. He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’”</p>
<p>“Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople. I have always longed to go to</p>
<p>Constantinople. Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that</p>
<p>the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the</p>
<p>roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm. She had</p>
<p>always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed. He saw, to his</p>
<p>surprise, that she was apparently serious.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends,</p>
<p>after Cissie Villa.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would</p>
<p>give anything to go with them.”</p>
<p>“Would your mother spare you again so soon? You have scarcely been home</p>
<p>three months.”</p>
<p>“She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement. “I simply</p>
<p>_must_ go away. I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through</p>
<p>her hair. “Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away? I didn’t realize at</p>
<p>the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.”</p>
<p>“You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. I knew you’d understand.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe did not quite understand. Why could not Miss Honeychurch</p>
<p>repose in the bosom of her family? Cecil had evidently taken up the</p>
<p>dignified line, and was not going to annoy her. Then it struck him that</p>
<p>her family itself might be annoying. He hinted this to her, and she</p>
<p>accepted the hint eagerly.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the</p>
<p>idea and everything has calmed down.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.</p>
<p>“No, not at all. Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you</p>
<p>the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so</p>
<p>masterful. I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way. He would</p>
<p>improve me in places where I can’t be improved. Cecil won’t let a woman</p>
<p>decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t. What nonsense I do talk! But</p>
<p>that is the kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what</p>
<p>I gather from all that I have known of you. I do sympathize and agree</p>
<p>most profoundly. I agree so much that you must let me make one little</p>
<p>criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?”</p>
<p>“But I must go somewhere!” she cried. “I have been worrying all the</p>
<p>morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with</p>
<p>clenched fists, and repeated: “I must! And the time I shall have with</p>
<p>mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring. You all think</p>
<p>much too highly of me. I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased. “I must get away, ever</p>
<p>so far. I must know my own mind and where I want to go.”</p>
<p>“Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out</p>
<p>of the front-door. He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.</p>
<p>When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the</p>
<p>tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.</p>
<p>“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.</p>
<p>“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.</p>
<p>“One is very thankful that she has such a resource. She is evidently</p>
<p>much worried, as, of course, she ought to be. I know all about it. The</p>
<p>marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she</p>
<p>could wind herself up to speak.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.</p>
<p>He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett. As he had put it to himself at</p>
<p>Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of</p>
<p>meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable. He</p>
<p>assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with</p>
<p>her. Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.</p>
<p>She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter</p>
<p>drop.”</p>
<p>“I wonder.”</p>
<p>“It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in</p>
<p>Summer Street. It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal</p>
<p>at the present moment.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows. Death is a strong word—surely too</p>
<p>strong. There was no question of tragedy. He said: “Of course, Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she</p>
<p>chooses. Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly. “Yet Freddy ought not to have</p>
<p>told even you. One cannot be too careful.”</p>
<p>“Quite so.”</p>
<p>“I do implore absolute secrecy. A chance word to a chattering friend,</p>
<p>and—”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the</p>
<p>exaggerated importance that they attach to words. A rector lives in a</p>
<p>web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is</p>
<p>the less he will regard them. He will change the subject, as did Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people</p>
<p>lately? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish. It is odd how we of</p>
<p>that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been</p>
<p>working into one another’s lives. Two, three, four, six of us—no,</p>
<p>eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch. We</p>
<p>must really give the Signora a testimonial.”</p>
<p>And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in</p>
<p>a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern. On the</p>
<p>summit they paused. The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last</p>
<p>hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.</p>
<p>Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and</p>
<p>shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there</p>
<p>gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue. Summer was retreating. The</p>
<p>wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for</p>
<p>those vast operations in heaven. The weather was breaking up, breaking,</p>
<p>broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural</p>
<p>that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery. Mr.</p>
<p>Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.</p>
<p>No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said:</p>
<p>“We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.</p>
<p>The darkness last night was appalling.”</p>
<p>They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock. That amiable</p>
<p>hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do</p>
<p>dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant</p>
<p>sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. Mr. Beebe saw that</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be</p>
<p>dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. They would</p>
<p>hand the child her food through the window. Thus he was incidentally</p>
<p>enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.</p>
<p>“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very</p>
<p>much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.</p>
<p>“Nothing about the past. I know little and care less about that; I am</p>
<p>absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit. She has acted</p>
<p>loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we</p>
<p>think too highly of her. But the future. Seriously, what do you think</p>
<p>of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again. “I don’t know</p>
<p>whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their</p>
<p>mad career. It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to</p>
<p>hesitate, and then read it again.</p>
<p>“I can’t see the point of it myself.”</p>
<p>To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you. In it</p>
<p>I spy Lucy’s salvation.”</p>
<p>“Really. Now, why?”</p>
<p>“She wanted to leave Windy Corner.”</p>
<p>“I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to</p>
<p>say—selfish.”</p>
<p>“It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire</p>
<p>a change.”</p>
<p>Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect</p>
<p>misses. Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another</p>
<p>lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced. Perhaps</p>
<p>she must have a change. I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand</p>
<p>these things. But why need she go as far as Greece?”</p>
<p>“You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently</p>
<p>interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner. “Why Greece?</p>
<p>(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?) Why not Tunbridge Wells? Oh, Mr. Beebe!</p>
<p>I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this</p>
<p>morning. I cannot help her. I will say no more. Perhaps I have already</p>
<p>said too much. I am not to talk. I wanted her to spend six months with</p>
<p>me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.</p>
<p>“But my feelings are of no importance. I know too well that I get on</p>
<p>Lucy’s nerves. Our tour was a failure. She wanted to leave Florence,</p>
<p>and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the</p>
<p>time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.”</p>
<p>“Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe. “I want</p>
<p>your advice.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to</p>
<p>him, though familiar to Lucy. “I for one will help her to go to Greece.</p>
<p>Will you?”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe considered.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and</p>
<p>whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.</p>
<p>“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this</p>
<p>odd woman really did know. “She must not stop here a moment, and we</p>
<p>must keep quiet till she goes. I trust that the servants know nothing.</p>
<p>Afterwards—but I may have said too much already. Only, Lucy and I are</p>
<p>helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone. If you help we may succeed.</p>
<p>Otherwise—”</p>
<p>“Otherwise—?”</p>
<p>“Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.</p>
<p>“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.</p>
<p>“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.”</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude. The tavern sign—a beehive</p>
<p>trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked</p>
<p>him. Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did</p>
<p>not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another</p>
<p>man” that would have attracted a grosser mind. He only felt that Miss</p>
<p>Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be</p>
<p>delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form. Its</p>
<p>very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry. His belief in</p>
<p>celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and</p>
<p>culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate</p>
<p>flower. “They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So</p>
<p>ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off</p>
<p>but with a slight feeling of pleasure. In the case of Lucy, the feeling</p>
<p>was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go</p>
<p>further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her</p>
<p>resolution of virginity. The feeling was very subtle and quite</p>
<p>undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in</p>
<p>this entanglement. Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action</p>
<p>subsequently, and his influence on the action of others. The compact</p>
<p>that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only</p>
<p>Lucy, but religion also.</p>
<p>They hurried home through a world of black and grey. He conversed on</p>
<p>indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants;</p>
<p>Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could</p>
<p>literature influence life? Windy Corner glimmered. In the garden, Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her</p>
<p>flowers.</p>
<p>“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly. “This comes of putting off. We</p>
<p>might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to</p>
<p>go to Greece. I don’t know what the world’s coming to.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must. Come up to the</p>
<p>house and let’s talk it over. Do you, in the first place, mind her</p>
<p>breaking with Vyse?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.”</p>
<p>“So am I,” said Freddy.</p>
<p>“Good. Now come up to the house.”</p>
<p>They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.</p>
<p>Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive</p>
<p>and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed. Nor would</p>
<p>Charlotte have succeeded. The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.</p>
<p>By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a</p>
<p>clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he</p>
<p>bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she</p>
<p>said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right. It must be something I</p>
<p>can’t understand. Lucy! Let’s tell her. Lucy!”</p>
<p>“She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said. He opened the door, and</p>
<p>heard the words of a song:</p>
<p>“Look not thou on beauty’s charming.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.”</p>
<p>“Sit thou still when kings are arming,</p>
<p>Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——”</p>
<p>“It’s a song that Cecil gave her. How odd girls are!”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.</p>
<p>“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly. She went into the</p>
<p>drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I</p>
<p>was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.”</p>
<p>Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a</p>
<p>bit.”</p>
<p>“And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the</p>
<p>Miss Alans will have you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, splendid! Oh, thank you!”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe followed. Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the</p>
<p>keys. She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. Her mother</p>
<p>bent over her. Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the</p>
<p>floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the group was beautiful. Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of</p>
<p>the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_,</p>
<p>in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together</p>
<p>about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and</p>
<p>therefore ignored by the art of to-day. Why should Lucy want either to</p>
<p>marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?</p>
<p>“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,</p>
<p>Speak not when the people listens,”</p>
<p>she continued.</p>
<p>“Here’s Mr. Beebe.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways.”</p>
<p>“It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he. “Go on.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly. “I forget why—harmony or</p>
<p>something.”</p>
<p>“I suspected it was unscholarly. It’s so beautiful.”</p>
<p>“The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten. Why</p>
<p>throw up the sponge?”</p>
<p>“How stupidly you talk!” said his sister. The _Santa Conversazione_ was</p>
<p>broken up. After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about</p>
<p>Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.</p>
<p>Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual</p>
<p>felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.”</p>
<p>“Stop thine ear against the singer—”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute; she is finishing.”</p>
<p>“From the red gold keep thy finger;</p>
<p>Vacant heart and hand and eye</p>
<p>Easy live and quiet die.”</p>
<p>“I love weather like this,” said Freddy.</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe passed into it.</p>
<p>The two main facts were clear. She had behaved splendidly, and he had</p>
<p>helped her. He could not expect to master the details of so big a</p>
<p>change in a girl’s life. If here and there he was dissatisfied or</p>
<p>puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.</p>
<p>“Vacant heart and hand and eye—”</p>
<p>Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly. He half</p>
<p>fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the</p>
<p>shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing</p>
<p>the words that it adorned:</p>
<p>“Vacant heart and hand and eye</p>
<p>Easy live and quiet die.”</p>
<p>However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a</p>
<p>beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.</p>
<p>Chapter XIX</p>
<p>Lying to Mr. Emerson</p>
<p>The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near</p>
<p>Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial</p>
<p>England. They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and</p>
<p>for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books,</p>
<p>mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.</p>
<p>That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them,</p>
<p>for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken</p>
<p>by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores. Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.</p>
<p>Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help</p>
<p>towards freshening up one’s face in the train. Lucy promised, a little</p>
<p>depressed.</p>
<p>“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse</p>
<p>to help you. A gentleman is such a stand-by.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to</p>
<p>drum nervously upon her card-case.</p>
<p>“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine</p>
<p>continued. “It is not every young man who would be so unselfish. But</p>
<p>perhaps he will come out and join you later on.”</p>
<p>“Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute</p>
<p>and less kindly of the two sisters.</p>
<p>“However, we shall see him when he sees you off. I do so long to see</p>
<p>him.”</p>
<p>“No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch. “She doesn’t</p>
<p>like it.”</p>
<p>“No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.</p>
<p>“Really? How funny! I should have thought that in this case—”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going? It is such a pleasure to have</p>
<p>met you!”</p>
<p>They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right. We just got</p>
<p>through that time.”</p>
<p>But her mother was annoyed. “I should be told, dear, that I am</p>
<p>unsympathetic. But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about</p>
<p>Cecil and be done with it. There all the time we had to sit fencing,</p>
<p>and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is</p>
<p>most unpleasant.”</p>
<p>Lucy had plenty to say in reply. She described the Miss Alans’</p>
<p>character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would</p>
<p>be everywhere in no time.</p>
<p>“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?”</p>
<p>“Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.</p>
<p>I shall tell them then. It’s much pleasanter. How wet it is! Let’s turn</p>
<p>in here.”</p>
<p>“Here” was the British Museum. Mrs. Honeychurch refused. If they must</p>
<p>take shelter, let it be in a shop. Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was</p>
<p>on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a</p>
<p>mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses</p>
<p>and gods.</p>
<p>“Oh, well, let it be shop, then. Let’s go to Mudie’s. I’ll buy a</p>
<p>guide-book.”</p>
<p>“You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so</p>
<p>stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this</p>
<p>hole-and-corner work. You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m</p>
<p>thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute. But why not</p>
<p>announce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?”</p>
<p>“It’s only for a few days.”</p>
<p>“But why at all?”</p>
<p>Lucy was silent. She was drifting away from her mother. It was quite</p>
<p>easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he</p>
<p>hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the</p>
<p>incidental advantage of being true. But she could not say it. She</p>
<p>disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that</p>
<p>king of terrors—Light. Ever since that last evening at Florence she had</p>
<p>deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent. She was thinking, “My daughter won’t</p>
<p>answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than</p>
<p>with Freddy and me. Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she</p>
<p>can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained</p>
<p>unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.”</p>
<p>This was perfectly true. Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when</p>
<p>she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no</p>
<p>longer. It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought</p>
<p>straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. She</p>
<p>did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself</p>
<p>must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very</p>
<p>instruments of life. She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off</p>
<p>my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece</p>
<p>because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look</p>
<p>up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone</p>
<p>else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and</p>
<p>anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she</p>
<p>proceeded with the conversation.</p>
<p>“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk! Of course I’m not tired of Windy</p>
<p>Corner.”</p>
<p>“Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?”</p>
<p>She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?”</p>
<p>“Hush, mother! People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s. She</p>
<p>bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home;</p>
<p>but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to</p>
<p>be away in the future more than I have been. You see, I come into my</p>
<p>money next year.”</p>
<p>Tears came into her mother’s eyes.</p>
<p>Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed</p>
<p>“eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear. “I’ve seen</p>
<p>the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy. I have seen so</p>
<p>little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket</p>
<p>like to-day, but to stop. I might even share a flat for a little with</p>
<p>some other girl.”</p>
<p>“And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.</p>
<p>“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police. And</p>
<p>call it a Mission—when no one wants you! And call it Duty—when it means</p>
<p>that you can’t stand your own home! And call it Work—when thousands of</p>
<p>men are starving with the competition as it is! And then to prepare</p>
<p>yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.”</p>
<p>“I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted</p>
<p>something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we</p>
<p>have not got it. She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those</p>
<p>had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than</p>
<p>short skirts and latch-keys. But independence was certainly her cue.</p>
<p>“Very well. Take your independence and be gone. Rush up and down and</p>
<p>round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.</p>
<p>Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he</p>
<p>planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.”</p>
<p>Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.”</p>
<p>“Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed. “How you do remind me of Charlotte</p>
<p>Bartlett!”</p>
<p>“_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid</p>
<p>pain.</p>
<p>“More every moment.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very</p>
<p>least alike.”</p>
<p>“Well, I see the likeness. The same eternal worrying, the same taking</p>
<p>back of words. You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among</p>
<p>three people last night might be sisters.”</p>
<p>“What rubbish! And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you</p>
<p>asked her to stop. I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you</p>
<p>not to, but of course it was not listened to.”</p>
<p>“There you go.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>“Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.”</p>
<p>Lucy clenched her teeth. “My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked</p>
<p>Charlotte to stop. I wish you would keep to the point.” And the</p>
<p>conversation died off into a wrangle.</p>
<p>She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train,</p>
<p>little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station. It had</p>
<p>poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes</p>
<p>showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on</p>
<p>the hood. Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy. Leaning forward,</p>
<p>she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp</p>
<p>pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing</p>
<p>beautiful. “The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she</p>
<p>remarked. For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street,</p>
<p>where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe’s old mother. “We shall have to sit three a side, because the</p>
<p>trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining. Oh, for a little air!” Then she</p>
<p>listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That</p>
<p>melody was blurred by the soft road. “_Can’t_ we have the hood down?”</p>
<p>she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well,</p>
<p>old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and</p>
<p>Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs.</p>
<p>Honeychurch’s neck. But now that the hood was down, she did see</p>
<p>something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the</p>
<p>windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw</p>
<p>a padlock.</p>
<p>“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes, miss,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Have they gone?”</p>
<p>“It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s</p>
<p>rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying</p>
<p>to let furnished,” was the answer.</p>
<p>“They have gone, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes, miss, they have gone.”</p>
<p>Lucy sank back. The carriage stopped at the Rectory. She got out to</p>
<p>call for Miss Bartlett. So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother</p>
<p>about Greece had been unnecessary. Waste! That word seemed to sum up</p>
<p>the whole of life. Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had</p>
<p>wounded her mother. Was it possible that she had muddled things away?</p>
<p>Quite possible. Other people had. When the maid opened the door, she</p>
<p>was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.</p>
<p>Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a</p>
<p>great favour: might she go to church? Mr. Beebe and his mother had</p>
<p>already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her</p>
<p>hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a</p>
<p>good ten minutes more.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily. “I forgot it was Friday. Let’s</p>
<p>all go. Powell can go round to the stables.”</p>
<p>“Lucy dearest—”</p>
<p>“No church for me, thank you.”</p>
<p>A sigh, and they departed. The church was invisible, but up in the</p>
<p>darkness to the left there was a hint of colour. This was a stained</p>
<p>window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door</p>
<p>opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a</p>
<p>minute congregation. Even their church, built upon the slope of the</p>
<p>hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of</p>
<p>silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one</p>
<p>never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.</p>
<p>She followed the maid into the Rectory.</p>
<p>Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study? There was only that</p>
<p>one fire.</p>
<p>She would not object.</p>
<p>Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait,</p>
<p>sir.”</p>
<p>Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a</p>
<p>gout-stool.</p>
<p>“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw</p>
<p>an alteration in him since last Sunday.</p>
<p>Not a word would come to her lips. George she had faced, and could have</p>
<p>faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.</p>
<p>“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry! George is so sorry! He</p>
<p>thought he had a right to try. I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he</p>
<p>had told me first. He ought not to have tried. I knew nothing about it</p>
<p>at all.”</p>
<p>If only she could remember how to behave!</p>
<p>He held up his hand. “But you must not scold him.”</p>
<p>Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.</p>
<p>“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love. I said: ‘When love</p>
<p>comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind. No. Passion</p>
<p>is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever</p>
<p>really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my</p>
<p>day is over, and though there is the result. Poor boy! He is so sorry!</p>
<p>He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that</p>
<p>whatever you felt you did not mean. Yet”—his voice gathered strength:</p>
<p>he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?”</p>
<p>Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries. Holding it</p>
<p>up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any</p>
<p>subject connected with your son.”</p>
<p>“But you do remember it?”</p>
<p>“He has misbehaved himself from the first.”</p>
<p>“I only was told that he loved you last Sunday. I never could judge</p>
<p>behaviour. I—I—suppose he has.”</p>
<p>Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to</p>
<p>him. His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were</p>
<p>sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.</p>
<p>“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said. “I am glad he is sorry. Do</p>
<p>you know what he did?”</p>
<p>“Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction. “He only tried when he</p>
<p>should not have tried. You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are</p>
<p>going to marry the man you love. Do not go out of George’s life saying</p>
<p>he is abominable.”</p>
<p>“No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.</p>
<p>“‘Abominable’ is much too strong. I am sorry I used it about your son.</p>
<p>I think I will go to church, after all. My mother and my cousin have</p>
<p>gone. I shall not be so very late—”</p>
<p>“Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head</p>
<p>fell on his chest.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“As his mother did.”</p>
<p>“But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr. Emerson_—what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.</p>
<p>Lucy was frightened.</p>
<p>“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when</p>
<p>he was twelve and she turned round. She thought it a judgement.” He</p>
<p>shuddered. “Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and</p>
<p>broken away from her parents. Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than</p>
<p>death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted</p>
<p>your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in</p>
<p>again! A judgement! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had</p>
<p>dropped water on him in church! Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch? Shall</p>
<p>we slip back into the darkness for ever?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” gasped Lucy. “I don’t understand this sort of thing. I</p>
<p>was not meant to understand it.”</p>
<p>“But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his</p>
<p>principles. I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was</p>
<p>well she was ill. He made her think about sin, and she went under</p>
<p>thinking about it.”</p>
<p>It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.</p>
<p>“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.</p>
<p>“He was not baptized,” said the old man. “I did hold firm.” And he</p>
<p>looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what</p>
<p>cost!—he had won a victory over them. “My boy shall go back to the</p>
<p>earth untouched.”</p>
<p>She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill.</p>
<p>“Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present. “George last Sunday—no,</p>
<p>not ill: just gone under. He is never ill. But he is his mother’s son.</p>
<p>Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful,</p>
<p>and he will not think it worth while to live. It was always touch and</p>
<p>go. He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live. He will</p>
<p>never think anything worth while. You remember that church at</p>
<p>Florence?”</p>
<p>Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect</p>
<p>postage stamps.</p>
<p>“After you left Florence—horrible. Then we took the house here, and he</p>
<p>goes bathing with your brother, and became better. You saw him</p>
<p>bathing?”</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair. I am deeply</p>
<p>sorry about it.”</p>
<p>“Then there came something about a novel. I didn’t follow it at all; I</p>
<p>had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old. Ah,</p>
<p>well, one must have failures. George comes down to-morrow, and takes me</p>
<p>up to his London rooms. He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be</p>
<p>where he is.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my</p>
<p>account. I am going to Greece. Don’t leave your comfortable house.”</p>
<p>It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled. “How good</p>
<p>everyone is! And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning</p>
<p>and heard I was going! Here I am so comfortable with a fire.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you won’t go back to London. It’s absurd.”</p>
<p>“I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he</p>
<p>can’t. He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am</p>
<p>not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t. I’ve been</p>
<p>bother enough to the world by now. I can’t have you moving out of your</p>
<p>house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my</p>
<p>account. You must stop! I am just going to Greece.”</p>
<p>“All the way to Greece?”</p>
<p>Her manner altered.</p>
<p>“To Greece?”</p>
<p>“So you must stop. You won’t talk about this business, I know. I can</p>
<p>trust you both.”</p>
<p>“Certainly you can. We either have you in our lives, or leave you to</p>
<p>the life that you have chosen.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t want—”</p>
<p>“I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George? No, it was wrong of</p>
<p>George to try. We have pushed our beliefs too far. I fancy that we</p>
<p>deserve sorrow.”</p>
<p>She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological</p>
<p>blue. They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on</p>
<p>the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling. To Lucy who could</p>
<p>not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful</p>
<p>that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy,</p>
<p>and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.</p>
<p>More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.</p>
<p>“No, please sit still. I think I will sit in the carriage.”</p>
<p>“Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.”</p>
<p>“Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.</p>
<p>“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you. And what were you</p>
<p>saying about going abroad?”</p>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<p>“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but</p>
<p>you were to be married this year, I thought.”</p>
<p>“Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands. Would she</p>
<p>tell an actual lie when it came to the point?</p>
<p>“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you. I hope—it isn’t because</p>
<p>George spoke that you are both going?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church. His cassock was covered</p>
<p>with rain. “That’s all right,” he said kindly. “I counted on you two</p>
<p>keeping each other company. It’s pouring again. The entire</p>
<p>congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my</p>
<p>mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. Did</p>
<p>Powell go round?”</p>
<p>“I think so; I’ll see.”</p>
<p>“No—of course, I’ll see. How are the Miss Alans?”</p>
<p>“Very well, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?”</p>
<p>“I—I did.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the</p>
<p>two Miss Alans? Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm. I think three</p>
<p>is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to</p>
<p>the stables.</p>
<p>“He is not going,” she said hoarsely. “I made a slip. Mr. Vyse does</p>
<p>stop behind in England.”</p>
<p>Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man. To George, to Cecil,</p>
<p>she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so</p>
<p>dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account,</p>
<p>and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths</p>
<p>that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry</p>
<p>of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the</p>
<p>old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was</p>
<p>not her companion to Greece. And she spoke so seriously that the risk</p>
<p>became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving</p>
<p>him? You are leaving the man you love?”</p>
<p>“I—I had to.”</p>
<p>“Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?”</p>
<p>Terror came over her, and she lied again. She made the long, convincing</p>
<p>speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the</p>
<p>world when she announced that her engagement was no more. He heard her</p>
<p>in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you. It seems</p>
<p>to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the</p>
<p>world. It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so</p>
<p>dreadful. It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the</p>
<p>things that I might have avoided. We can help one another but little. I</p>
<p>used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know</p>
<p>better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware</p>
<p>of muddle. Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be</p>
<p>annoyed with me and weren’t? Do you remember before, when you refused</p>
<p>the room with the view? Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am</p>
<p>fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent. “Don’t trust me, Miss</p>
<p>Honeychurch. Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was</p>
<p>still silent. “‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance</p>
<p>on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’</p>
<p>I think he puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his functions as</p>
<p>he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out</p>
<p>excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean. You love George!” And after</p>
<p>his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from</p>
<p>the open sea.</p>
<p>“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction. “You love the</p>
<p>boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other</p>
<p>word expresses it. You won’t marry the other man for his sake.”</p>
<p>“How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.</p>
<p>“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking</p>
<p>about a man.”</p>
<p>“But you are.”</p>
<p>She summoned physical disgust.</p>
<p>“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you. It’s the only hope at times.</p>
<p>I can reach you no other way. You must marry, or your life will be</p>
<p>wasted. You have gone too far to retreat. I have no time for the</p>
<p>tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that</p>
<p>really matter, and _for which_ you marry. I know that, with George, you</p>
<p>will find them, and that you love him. Then be his wife. He is already</p>
<p>part of you. Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or</p>
<p>forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.</p>
<p>It isn’t possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You</p>
<p>can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out</p>
<p>of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is</p>
<p>eternal.”</p>
<p>Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon,</p>
<p>her tears remained.</p>
<p>“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the</p>
<p>body, but of the body. Ah! the misery that would be saved if we</p>
<p>confessed that! Ah! for a little directness to liberate the soul! Your</p>
<p>soul, dear Lucy! I hate the word now, because of all the cant with</p>
<p>which superstition has wrapped it round. But we have souls. I cannot</p>
<p>say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you</p>
<p>ruining yours. I cannot bear it. It is again the darkness creeping in;</p>
<p>it is hell.” Then he checked himself. “What nonsense I have talked—how</p>
<p>abstract and remote! And I have made you cry! Dear girl, forgive my</p>
<p>prosiness; marry my boy. When I think what life is, and how seldom love</p>
<p>is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the</p>
<p>world was made.”</p>
<p>She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote. Yet as he</p>
<p>spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the</p>
<p>bottom of her soul.</p>
<p>“Then, Lucy—”</p>
<p>“You’ve frightened me,” she moaned. “Cecil—Mr. Beebe—the ticket’s</p>
<p>bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair. “I’m caught in the</p>
<p>tangle. I must suffer and grow old away from him. I cannot break the</p>
<p>whole of life for his sake. They trusted me.”</p>
<p>A carriage drew up at the front-door.</p>
<p>“Give George my love—once only. Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged</p>
<p>her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.</p>
<p>“Lucy—”</p>
<p>“No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—”</p>
<p>“But why should they, when you have deceived them?”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.”</p>
<p>“You’re not worthy of their trust.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.</p>
<p>“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?”</p>
<p>“One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.</p>
<p>“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson. To whom do you refer? Trust whom?”</p>
<p>“I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George. They</p>
<p>have loved one another all along.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl. He was very quiet, and his white</p>
<p>face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman. A long black</p>
<p>column, he stood and awaited her reply.</p>
<p>“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.</p>
<p>A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—”</p>
<p>“Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!”</p>
<p>“It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly. “It’s the part of people</p>
<p>that you don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.</p>
<p>“Lucy! Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.</p>
<p>“Mr. Beebe, could you help me?”</p>
<p>He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am</p>
<p>more grieved than I can possibly express. It is lamentable,</p>
<p>lamentable—incredible.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.</p>
<p>“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me. Marry</p>
<p>George, Miss Honeychurch. He will do admirably.”</p>
<p>He walked out and left them. They heard him guiding his mother</p>
<p>up-stairs.</p>
<p>“Lucy!” the voices called.</p>
<p>She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair. But his face revived her. It was</p>
<p>the face of a saint who understood.</p>
<p>“Now it is all dark. Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.</p>
<p>I know. But remember the mountains over Florence and the view. Ah,</p>
<p>dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.</p>
<p>You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the</p>
<p>muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your</p>
<p>friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever</p>
<p>right to despise. George still dark, all the tussle and the misery</p>
<p>without a word from him. Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.</p>
<p>“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.</p>
<p>Truth counts, Truth does count.”</p>
<p>“You kiss me,” said the girl. “You kiss me. I will try.”</p>
<p>He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining</p>
<p>the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.</p>
<p>Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his</p>
<p>salutation remained. He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s</p>
<p>taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.</p>
<p>She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he</p>
<p>managed to strengthen her. It was as if he had made her see the whole</p>
<p>of everything at once.”</p>
<p>Chapter XX</p>
<p>The End of the Middle Ages</p>
<p>The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves. They</p>
<p>alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of</p>
<p>the Saronic gulf. They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either</p>
<p>shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue</p>
<p>seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze</p>
<p>charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity. Trembling, anxious,</p>
<p>cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople,</p>
<p>they did go round the world. The rest of us must be contented with a</p>
<p>fair, but a less arduous, goal. Italiam petimus: we return to the</p>
<p>Pension Bertolini.</p>
<p>George said it was his old room.</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had</p>
<p>your father’s room. I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.”</p>
<p>He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.</p>
<p>“George, you baby, get up.”</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.</p>
<p>Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was</p>
<p>trying to mend, and gazed out through the window. It was evening and</p>
<p>again the spring.</p>
<p>“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully. “What can such people be</p>
<p>made of?”</p>
<p>“Same stuff as parsons are made of.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!”</p>
<p>“Quite right. It is nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism</p>
<p>next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.”</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and</p>
<p>advancing his face to hers. “What’s there to cry at? Kiss me here.” He</p>
<p>indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.</p>
<p>He was a boy after all. When it came to the point, it was she who</p>
<p>remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who</p>
<p>knew whose room this had been last year. It endeared him to her</p>
<p>strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.</p>
<p>“Any letters?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Just a line from Freddy.”</p>
<p>“Now kiss me here; then here.”</p>
<p>Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window,</p>
<p>opened it (as the English will), and leant out. There was the parapet,</p>
<p>there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills. The</p>
<p>cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might</p>
<p>be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve</p>
<p>months ago. A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the</p>
<p>South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things</p>
<p>who had taken so much trouble about a young fool. He had helped</p>
<p>himself, it is true, but how stupidly!</p>
<p>All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his</p>
<p>father, by his wife.</p>
<p>“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its</p>
<p>name is, still shows.”</p>
<p>“San Miniato. I’ll just finish your sock.”</p>
<p>“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging</p>
<p>certainty.</p>
<p>George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away</p>
<p>on driving.</p>
<p>And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils,</p>
<p>the Miss Bartletts! Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the</p>
<p>forces that had swept him into this contentment.</p>
<p>“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?”</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the</p>
<p>Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past</p>
<p>hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.</p>
<p>“What does he say?”</p>
<p>“Silly boy! He thinks he’s being dignified. He knew we should go off in</p>
<p>the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give</p>
<p>her consent we should take the thing into our own hands. They had fair</p>
<p>warning, and now he calls it an elopement. Ridiculous boy—”</p>
<p>“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—”</p>
<p>“But it will all come right in the end. He has to build us both up from</p>
<p>the beginning again. I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so</p>
<p>cynical about women. He has, for the second time, quite altered. Why</p>
<p>will men have theories about women? I haven’t any about men. I wish,</p>
<p>too, that Mr. Beebe—”</p>
<p>“You may well wish that.”</p>
<p>“He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us</p>
<p>again. I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner. I</p>
<p>wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us</p>
<p>are sure to come back to us in the long run.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only</p>
<p>thing I did do—and you came back to me. So possibly you know.” He</p>
<p>turned back into the room. “Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to</p>
<p>the window, so that she, too, saw all the view. They sank upon their</p>
<p>knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one</p>
<p>another’s names. Ah! it was worth while; it was the great joy that they</p>
<p>had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.</p>
<p>They were silent.</p>
<p>“Signorino, domani faremo—”</p>
<p>“Oh, bother that man!”</p>
<p>But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be</p>
<p>rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.</p>
<p>Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte. How cruel she would be</p>
<p>to a man like that!”</p>
<p>“Look at the lights going over the bridge.”</p>
<p>“But this room reminds me of Charlotte. How horrible to grow old in</p>
<p>Charlotte’s way! To think that evening at the rectory that she</p>
<p>shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house. For she would have</p>
<p>stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have</p>
<p>made me see sense. You couldn’t have made me. When I am very happy”—she</p>
<p>kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs. If Charlotte had</p>
<p>only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone</p>
<p>to silly Greece, and become different for ever.”</p>
<p>“But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely. He</p>
<p>said so.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, she didn’t see him. She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe,</p>
<p>don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church. She said so.”</p>
<p>George was obstinate again. “My father,” said he, “saw her, and I</p>
<p>prefer his word. He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his</p>
<p>eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett. A few minutes before you came in.</p>
<p>She was turning to go as he woke up. He didn’t speak to her.”</p>
<p>Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have</p>
<p>been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly</p>
<p>in each other’s arms. It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett,</p>
<p>but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting. George, who</p>
<p>disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew. Then, why did</p>
<p>she risk the meeting? She knew he was there, and yet she went to</p>
<p>church.”</p>
<p>They tried to piece the thing together.</p>
<p>As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind. She</p>
<p>rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble</p>
<p>muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the</p>
<p>roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words</p>
<p>fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?”</p>
<p>“Mean what?”</p>
<p>“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—”</p>
<p>Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.</p>
<p>Siamo sposati.”</p>
<p>“Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up</p>
<p>his horse.</p>
<p>“Buona sera—e grazie.”</p>
<p>“Niente.”</p>
<p>The cabman drove away singing.</p>
<p>“Mean what, George?”</p>
<p>He whispered: “Is it this? Is this possible? I’ll put a marvel to you.</p>
<p>That your cousin has always hoped. That from the very first moment we</p>
<p>met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of</p>
<p>course, very far down. That she fought us on the surface, and yet she</p>
<p>hoped. I can’t explain her any other way. Can you? Look how she kept me</p>
<p>alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after</p>
<p>month she became more eccentric and unreliable. The sight of us haunted</p>
<p>her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend. There</p>
<p>are details—it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She is not frozen,</p>
<p>Lucy, she is not withered up all through. She tore us apart twice, but</p>
<p>in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us</p>
<p>happy. We can never make friends with her or thank her. But I do</p>
<p>believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and</p>
<p>behaviour, she is glad.”</p>
<p>“It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the</p>
<p>experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.”</p>
<p>Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited,</p>
<p>love attained. But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than</p>
<p>this. The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows</p>
<p>of winter into the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>

<p>States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the</p>
<p>United States and you are located in the United States, we do not</p>
<p>claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,</p>
<p>displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as</p>
<p>all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope</p>
<p>that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting</p>
<p>free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the</p>

<p>agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,</p>

<p>phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,</p>
<p>performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most</p>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is</p>
<p>derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not</p>
<p>contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the</p>
<p>copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in</p>
<p>the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are</p>

<p>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including</p>
<p>any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access</p>

<p>(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense</p>
<p>to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means</p>
<p>of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain</p>

<p>provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from</p>
<p>the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method</p>
<p>you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed</p>
<p>to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has</p>
<p>agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid</p>
<p>within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are</p>
<p>legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty</p>
<p>payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in</p>

<p>Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies</p>
<p>you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he</p>
<p>does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all</p>
<p>copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue</p>
<p>all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of</p>
<p>any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the</p>
<p>electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of</p>
<p>receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free</p>
<p>distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>

<p>Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than</p>
<p>are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing</p>
<p>from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of</p>

<p>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread</p>

<p>contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate</p>
<p>or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other</p>

<p>Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all</p>
<p>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal</p>
<p>fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT</p>

<p>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE</p>
<p>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR</p>
<p>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</p>

<p>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of</p>
<p>damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement</p>
<p>violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the</p>
<p>agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or</p>
<p>limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or</p>
<p>unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the</p>
<p>remaining provisions.</p>
<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the</p>
<p>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone</p>
<p>providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in</p>
<p>accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the</p>
<p>production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,</p>
<p>including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of</p>
<p>the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this</p>
<p>or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or</p>
<p>additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any</p>
<p>Defect you cause.</p>
<p>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of</p>
<p>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of</p>
<p>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It</p>
<p>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations</p>
<p>from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the</p>
<p>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s</p>
<p>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will</p>
<p>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure</p>
<p>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future</p>
<p>generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>
<p>Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see</p>
<p>Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<p>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg</p>
<p>Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread</p>
<p>public support and donations to carry out its mission of</p>
<p>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</p>
<p>freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest</p>
<p>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations</p>
<p>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt</p>
<p>status with the IRS.</p>
<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</p>
<p>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</p>
<p>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</p>
<p>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</p>
<p>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations</p>
<p>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND</p>
<p>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state</p>
<p>visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</p>
<p>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition</p>
<p>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</p>

<p>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be</p>
<p>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and</p>
<p>distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of</p>
<p>volunteer support.</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed</p>
<p>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in</p>
<p>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not</p>
<p>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper</p>
<p>edition.</p>
<p>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search</p>
<p>facility: www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,</p>
<p>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>
<p>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to</p>
<p>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
