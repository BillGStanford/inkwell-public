<p>LUMMOX</p>
<p>Nobody quite knew just what Baltic bloods flowed in sullen and alien</p>
<p>rivers through Bertha's veins--or cared, might be added. Bertha,</p>
<p>least of all.</p>
<p>She was five feet, nine and a half, of flat-breasted bigness and her</p>
<p>cheek-bones were pitched like Norn's. Little tents. There must have</p>
<p>been a good smattering of Scandinavian and even a wide streak of</p>
<p>western Teutonic. Slav, too. Because unaccountably she found</p>
<p>herself knowing the Polish national anthem. Recognized it with her</p>
<p>heart as it rattled out of a hurdy-gurdy.</p>
<p>In her carpetbag, an outlandish one with a steamship stamp on it,</p>
<p>were a bit of Bulgarian embroidery, a runic brooch, a concertina with</p>
<p>a punctured bellows and an ikon in imitation mosaic. Old world.</p>
<p>And yet Bertha had been born in a furiously dark sailors' lodging</p>
<p>house in Front Street, where New York harbor smells of spices and</p>
<p>city garbage rides by to the dump on barges. One of those</p>
<p>frightening emergency births of rusty instruments, midwifery and a</p>
<p>sinister room made more terrible by the travail of her coming. Of no</p>
<p>particular father (although the China seas could probably have</p>
<p>yielded up the secret of his rollicking lane), and of a dead mother.</p>
<p>She had died two minutes before Bertha was born. Annie Wennerberg,</p>
<p>landlady of the sailors' lodging house, who reared Bertha those first</p>
<p>dozen years of her life that were sopping wet with scrub-water and</p>
<p>soft-soap, knew. Horrid scuttling rat-like things that Annie</p>
<p>Wennerberg knew.</p>
<p>Born of a dead mother,</p>
<p>Secrets of the grave you'll utter.</p>
<p>That couplet could run down Bertha's spinal cord like a mouse.</p>
<p>"I don't know any secrets of the grave, Annie."</p>
<p>"You do. They're written on your face. You got a look in that wide</p>
<p>place between your eyes like the sound of a clump of dirt falling on</p>
<p>a coffin. You're as full of secrets as a cow's tail is of burrs."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Wildly, and with a coherence she could have torn open her throat for,</p>
<p>Bertha wanted to tell Annie that her secrets, if any she had, were of</p>
<p>life, not death. The knowledges that came to her in chimes from the</p>
<p>dark forests within her where the trees could somehow seem to stand</p>
<p>with folded arms regarding her and the air to be wisps of old sound.</p>
<p>Snacks of melodies out of eastern Europe. Secrets that shimmered.</p>
<p>But it seemed to Bertha that her tongue was merely the shallow pan</p>
<p>for those few words at her disposal which rattled off it so hollowly.</p>
<p>It was so hard to talk. Words. Frail beasts of burden that crashed</p>
<p>down to their knees under what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>How to convey to Annie Wennerberg that her mother had not dragged her</p>
<p>down to the clayey secrets of the grave but had endowed her with</p>
<p>lovely, bosky, dell-like secrets of life. Those were the meanings of</p>
<p>the wide silence of space between her eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't know nothing about the grave, Annie--"</p>
<p>"You do. For two minutes you was in the grave with your dead</p>
<p>mother--yah--yah--</p>
<p>Born of a dead mother,</p>
<p>Secrets of the grave you'll utter."</p>
<p>Bertha wondered. But not unduly. She thought so dimly, almost as if</p>
<p>she had breathed on a mirror and reflection could not come through.</p>
<p>For that matter she even felt dimly.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," she once said to Annie Wennerberg, "I feel like my skin</p>
<p>was a thick piece of flannel, between the inside of me and the</p>
<p>outside."</p>
<p>Annie's retort was a single vile word. They jumped off her lips</p>
<p>constantly, like hop-toads.</p>
<p>But somewhere in Bertha's mists were ecstasies. She would sit on the</p>
<p>stairs at night, and huddle over to the banister for the passing of a</p>
<p>drunken sailor, scarcely conscious that his enormous clod of a</p>
<p>mud-caked shoe was almost in her face.</p>
<p>She slept on a cot that crawled with vermin, with the beauty of</p>
<p>repose on that face of hers which was said to look like the sound of</p>
<p>a clump of dirt on a coffin.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Once, way back before she had gone to the Farleys, she had worked out</p>
<p>"by the day" as the saying goes. Odd jobs. Cleaning an old</p>
<p>rooming-house for new occupancy on very East Seventeenth Street.</p>
<p>Corners to be scraped out with a knife. Scrub water that became</p>
<p>livid. Stench. Two men had sickened at the job and quit. Yet</p>
<p>Bertha, with her lips held very tightly it is true, scraped and</p>
<p>scraped, until actually, standing there at the sink, poking webby</p>
<p>stuff through the drain hole, chimes came through to her from the</p>
<p>dark forest. The forest that was Baltic and western Teutonic.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes, because of these great inner reaches of her, even the</p>
<p>chimes arrived to her dimly. Muted melodies. Wanting-to-be-born</p>
<p>thoughts. Bertha's prisoners.</p>
<p>She liked, after her day's work was done, to sit with them. Little</p>
<p>bells in lovely headache against her brow. Words.</p>
<p>"Lyric" was a beautiful word. Rollo Farley had used it to a young</p>
<p>girl at dinner, who had listened to him with the nape of her neck</p>
<p>stretched and her lips scarlet. It had come through to Bertha</p>
<p>peering from behind the pantry door. "Lyric," a golden word shaped</p>
<p>like a harp.</p>
<p>She liked to say it and feel it race delicately around her lips as if</p>
<p>it were a high-strung little roulette ball in its bowl.</p>
<p>Sometimes she spat like a peasant, of slow reflection.</p>
<p>There was a sliver of kitchen porch and a pad of backyard with a</p>
<p>magnolia tree in it, behind the Farley house in Gramercy Park. She</p>
<p>had seen that magnolia heavy with bud six beautiful times. She had</p>
<p>cooked for the Farleys six years.</p>
<p>In spring, after the great dish pan with the gray cloth drying over</p>
<p>it was turned to the wall and the linoleum smelling wetly from her</p>
<p>mop, Bertha would sit out there on the sliver of porch waiting the</p>
<p>interim between dinner and light refreshments of sandwiches and fresh</p>
<p>fruit to be sent into the drawing room at eleven. Would sit</p>
<p>barefoot. They were strong feet, still warm and damp from shoes.</p>
<p>Great pale spuds with muscular toes that could spread separately like</p>
<p>a wine presser's, and were full of a predatory power to clutch.</p>
<p>She could almost breathe in with her feet. She liked to feel their</p>
<p>bareness pat at the old cheek of earth. All the big-footed and</p>
<p>barefooted women out of her Baltic and Teutonic hinterlands rebelled</p>
<p>against Bertha's shoes. They gave her bunions. Bulbs that projected</p>
<p>off her foot like a nose, giving the shoe, after one day's wearing,</p>
<p>the profile of a mean old man. So she padded around the kitchen</p>
<p>barefoot, when Mrs. Farley's invasions, or Helga's the housemaid,</p>
<p>were unlikely. There was a wininess in their bare contacts.</p>
<p>Breathers. Suckers in of the little vibratory messages that run</p>
<p>across floors. Toes. The prehensile curving of toes around the</p>
<p>branches of the dark forest....</p>
<p>Once Mrs. Farley, sweeping through the swinging door into the</p>
<p>kitchen, found her on her knees before the oven basting a</p>
<p>Thanksgiving turkey, the soles of her bare feet upright and staring</p>
<p>out from under her cotton skirts like lantern-jawed faces.</p>
<p>"Bertha, don't ever let me find you barefoot in the kitchen again.</p>
<p>It's disgusting."</p>
<p>"Yah'm."</p>
<p>Submission was so easy. Shoes. They were part of the day and the</p>
<p>day was like a garment fashioned by the employment agency; the lady</p>
<p>of the house; and for the last six years by Mrs. Farley.</p>
<p>There is not much of Mrs. Farley in this telling. She paid Bertha</p>
<p>twenty dollars a month (it was the day of the cable-car and there was</p>
<p>some talk of a Louisiana Purchase Exposition to be held in St.</p>
<p>Louis), clucked her tongue against the roof of her mouth when she</p>
<p>told about it and said, "What's the world coming to?"</p>
<p>She was kind enough in a fusty way, wore invariable black velvet neck</p>
<p>bands, saved twine, and gave every other Monday afternoon to the</p>
<p>Tenement Hygienic Committee of the Human Welfare League.</p>
<p>Helga, whose back always ached and who kept twenty rooms swept and</p>
<p>dusted, was expected to sit up for Mrs. Farley until after theater</p>
<p>for the single process of massaging the wattles underneath the band</p>
<p>of black velvet.</p>
<p>Bertha scrubbed and cooked from the servants' breakfast hour at</p>
<p>six-thirty to family dinner at eight P.M. and often until eleven,</p>
<p>when there were the sandwiches and light refreshments to be prepared.</p>
<p>Helga spat on the Human Welfare League pamphlets and gritted her</p>
<p>teeth at them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farley was also on the letterhead of an organization called The</p>
<p>Circle for Housing Relief.</p>
<p>Bertha's room cowed under the roof of the finely austere house in</p>
<p>Gramercy Park beneath a slant ceiling that was like a threatening</p>
<p>slap. No heat unless she left the door open and the warm breath of</p>
<p>downstairs came up. A bed with a short fourth leg and a spring that</p>
<p>sagged like a hammock to the considerable heft of Bertha's body. A</p>
<p>bureau rigged up out of a discarded desk of Rollo Farley's and a</p>
<p>pitcher and bowl on a soap box. For six years Bertha slept up there</p>
<p>with that slanting ceiling on her chest. But usually she was so very</p>
<p>tired that her sleep was like a death and the slant a clod of earth</p>
<p>on the grave of another day.</p>
<p>Bertha was a good cook. "A good plain cook," Mrs. Farley apologized</p>
<p>in her invitations to the more informal of her dinner parties. But</p>
<p>she could do curlicues in icing. Bone squab. Work with such</p>
<p>esoteric ingredients as marron glace, pickled walnuts, and capers,</p>
<p>illuminate carrots into rosettes, and stir a fish sauce with just the</p>
<p>tricky rightness of the tartar touch. Rollo Farley had a frail</p>
<p>digestion. Bertha had learned to broil and coddle for him and knew</p>
<p>just the turn of his chop.</p>
<p>"She's a great unresponsive hunky sort of girl," Mrs. Farley would</p>
<p>recite of her. "Swede, I imagine, or perhaps one of those blonde</p>
<p>Poles. But she's a good plain cook and knows Rollo's diet. Good as</p>
<p>one can do nowadays. Does not run about either, as so many of them</p>
<p>do. Too lazy I suppose. Justs sits and daydreams. But anything is</p>
<p>preferable to changing and having to start on the rounds of the</p>
<p>employment agencies."</p>
<p>Bertha had an equal horror of employment agencies. Shambles of</p>
<p>sullen stock awaiting inspection. The lorgnette fusillade. The</p>
<p>bitter shameless questionings, like an apple corer plunging down into</p>
<p>the heart.</p>
<p>"What is that on your face? I hope it isn't a rash. Do you expect</p>
<p>every Thursday out? You bathe regularly, of course? You understand</p>
<p>that my cook always helps with the housework on the maid's day out.</p>
<p>I've a half-grown daughter and cannot permit my help to entertain men</p>
<p>in the kitchen. Newspapers are full of such dreadful things. Would</p>
<p>you mind having your things fumigated before you bring them to the</p>
<p>house? Can't be too careful...."</p>
<p>So Bertha stayed on at the Farleys, and when she had been there six</p>
<p>years Mrs. Farley gave her a cast-off opera cloak of sea-green</p>
<p>chiffon. It was rather funny in a way. Bertha of strong sweat and</p>
<p>hands that could entrail fowl at one tear, in sea-green chiffon. She</p>
<p>never tried it on, it would have embarrassed her, but the green</p>
<p>seemed to fill her attic room like sea. Beautiful sea, that instead</p>
<p>of rolling and hurting like a prisoner in her heart, was here on the</p>
<p>outside where she could touch it. The delicate fabric clung to the</p>
<p>roughness of her hands. In its way that chiffon was like the Polish</p>
<p>national anthem which she could hear so poignantly with her heart, or</p>
<p>like the word "Lyric" which she could feel with her teeth when she</p>
<p>repeated it softly to herself.</p>
<p>After that she began to watch through the swinging door of the</p>
<p>pantry, the fabrics on the backs of women at dinner. Satin, Velvet</p>
<p>that was like a silence. Once she found a bit of torn-off spangled</p>
<p>trimming and put it in the drawer with her ocean. Stars. She had</p>
<p>only to jerk open that drawer and they lay there, lit and waiting.</p>
<p>One night at a formal dinner to sixteen, there was an ex-ambassador,</p>
<p>and she had two helpers from the employment agency, and so could sit</p>
<p>at the crack in the swinging door between courses. Candlelight</p>
<p>bending and bowing into crystal and silver. Calla lilies. Mrs.</p>
<p>Farley's harp, a curve of gold beside the buffet. Little hissing</p>
<p>pools of wine. Mrs. Farley's back was half bare, and it sloped down</p>
<p>into a valley at the spine. An old sunken back. Not nice. Nathan</p>
<p>Farley's bald head and face were very red, so that his white mustache</p>
<p>seen from the crack in the swinging door was almost like a frothing</p>
<p>at the mouth. His kiss might leave suds.</p>
<p>Locked up gargoyles of thoughts in Bertha for which she had no words,</p>
<p>except those feeble ones which fell to their knees like the frail</p>
<p>beasts of burden.</p>
<p>There was a very long and slender-necked girl at the table with cool</p>
<p>lips and a head the lovely shape of an egg, the hair revealing the</p>
<p>face like reluctantly parted portières. To Bertha, who felt but</p>
<p>could not say it, the lovely ellipsity of that head was like putting</p>
<p>an egg whole into your mouth and then feeling it slowly come out.</p>
<p>Rollo Farley was talking to her. Bertha had prepared an aspic jelly</p>
<p>for him, skilfully camouflaged to resemble the fish course that was</p>
<p>going its rounds on an enormous silver platter flaming with carrot</p>
<p>rosettes. Fish disagreed. He slid his fork into the aspic,</p>
<p>carefully anticipating the deception, but constantly face to face</p>
<p>with the lovely oval creature.</p>
<p>Rollo was about Bertha's age. But his flesh much tenderer. The</p>
<p>quality of breast-of-fowl. Fuzz of down on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Nervous hands as if the fingers were dripping from them like icicles.</p>
<p>He wrote with them, using a softly whispering pencil all through the</p>
<p>forenoon and sometimes long after the household slept. Once Bertha,</p>
<p>dusting his small, book-lined study on Helga's day out, read from one</p>
<p>of the sheets on his desk. Short lines leaving much of the paper</p>
<p>white. Lines that rocked softly like a boat with a lateen sail.</p>
<p>Rhythm. "Love. Rove." "Pagan. Raven." "Lyre. Desire."</p>
<p>Flash. Flash. Flash. A plunging opal horse and a jade terrific</p>
<p>lion and a lapis lazuli centaur, riding round and round again into</p>
<p>alternate view on the merry-go-round.</p>
<p>She had dusted the wide-margined paper with the click of flame color</p>
<p>through the words. As if you opened and closed your eyes very</p>
<p>rapidly. Had dusted it dispassionately enough, but her throat felt</p>
<p>all rigid. Tight enough for tears....</p>
<p>She was dispassionate now through the crack in the door. Except that</p>
<p>the down on the back of Rollo's neck was so--so young. Heart hurting.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At ten o'clock the great dish pan was turned, the helpers gone, Helga</p>
<p>whispering at the service entrance with the night watchman, and</p>
<p>Bertha who had sweated, out on the back porch, barefooted and cooling</p>
<p>in the spring.</p>
<p>A night the color of a frosted grape. The hoar of an invisible moon.</p>
<p>The magnolia. Big silences standing still in Bertha. Silences that</p>
<p>to be told at all must be told silently....</p>
<p>The iceman had caught her that morning unawares, slapping his hand</p>
<p>down on her square hips. It was the first time a man had touched her.</p>
<p>"Hello, Bertha, got the Yonnie Yump Ups this morning?"</p>
<p>"Go away, you nervy!"</p>
<p>"Say 'Yonnie Yump Up.'"</p>
<p>"Yah--you--get--out--"</p>
<p>Bertha could not say J. It melted in her throat. She didn't know</p>
<p>the reason, but she looked the reason, Swedishly. The great broad</p>
<p>face. Pitched-tent cheek bones. The square teeth and flaring lips.</p>
<p>The nose with the flanges spread like the fat haunches of a squatting</p>
<p>idol. Eyes like globes of clear water against blue sky, but</p>
<p>occasional darts through. Goldfish flanks. Braids of yellow hair</p>
<p>strapped around her head in bandeaux.</p>
<p>In her body bigness lay beauty. Godiva's gleam. Light breasts, the</p>
<p>way the Greeks loved them, without sag. Long white line of femur.</p>
<p>Hip rhythm. The touch of the iceman's hands, hours old; hunky hands</p>
<p>that she had rejected, still lay on those hips, as if clay had</p>
<p>hardened there.</p>
<p>It was pleasant to sit on the sliver of porch with the feel of hands</p>
<p>through the cotton stuff and on to her flesh.</p>
<p>After a while Rollo Farley came out on the porch. He was dizzy.</p>
<p>Wine. Heat. And his mother had warned him against the croquilles.</p>
<p>The air was like a lady with a slow fan. Little stirs of it. Cool.</p>
<p>The smell of magnolia. Almost immediately the little beads on his</p>
<p>forehead went out like lights and his wrists dried.</p>
<p>"Hello, Bertha," he said.</p>
<p>She sat with her knees very wide apart in an enormous cradle and her</p>
<p>hands hanging in it.</p>
<p>"Hul," she said.</p>
<p>He leaned against the wall with his hand back between him and the</p>
<p>brick. Little noises under the silence. His shirt front, champing</p>
<p>at a pearl stud. He slid his hand into his pocket. She could hear</p>
<p>his nearness.</p>
<p>"Good God, what starlight," he said finally, looking up through the</p>
<p>moon hoar and doing a sort of calisthenics with his arms until the</p>
<p>cuffs shot.</p>
<p>She sat.</p>
<p>He said strange, beautiful things sometimes. Words. She treasured</p>
<p>them as a lapidary his stones. Occasionally he addressed her as she</p>
<p>dusted his books on Helga's day out, much as he might have a newel</p>
<p>post or the terra cotta Chloe on his desk.</p>
<p>"Sonnet" was another dear word. He had used it to himself more than</p>
<p>once as she tiptoed. A word to lay away in the heart. "Good God,</p>
<p>what starlight." Anyone might have said that--and yet--</p>
<p>"Bertha," he said finally, addressing her as if she were his</p>
<p>cigarette smoke, "keep close to life. Don't let them find your</p>
<p>nerves--or your soul."</p>
<p>"... or her soul!" Bertha whose being was a callous spot through</p>
<p>which the soul could not quite hurt through.</p>
<p>"Your problems are husky ones, Bertha. To-morrow's menu. It will</p>
<p>warm the stomach, but it leaves the heart alone. Keep close to life,</p>
<p>Bertha. Cabbages are beautiful and only a little tougher fibred than</p>
<p>roses."</p>
<p>Vaporings. He was twenty-five and a poet.</p>
<p>Close to life. What was that? Close to life. Her toes dug down</p>
<p>against the floor as if they would translate it for her.</p>
<p>He looked down at their white movement.</p>
<p>"Why, Bertha," he said, "your feet are like two big white magnolias</p>
<p>off our tree."</p>
<p>She loved that, but she wiggled her toes and said, "They hurt."</p>
<p>He looked again at their white movement. The toes wiggling now under</p>
<p>his words. Luscious feet that listened to the soil and stole its</p>
<p>secrets. A sublime kind of capillarity. Bertha feeling for</p>
<p>closeness to life with her feet.</p>
<p>Thick white feet, yet begetting in Rollo thoughts too fragile to hold</p>
<p>in even the facets of a poet's brain. Thoughts as fragile as the</p>
<p>throat of the nightingale that sang outside the emperor's window.</p>
<p>Actually for the first time in the six years, Rollo looked at Bertha</p>
<p>with his attention. Splay mouthed. High cheeked. Muscular toed. A</p>
<p>soaking kind of peasantry that flowed into him and made him want to</p>
<p>write it out again in a meter that was like the clump of wooden shoes.</p>
<p>And then he looked at her waist, where because she had sweated, it</p>
<p>lay open. Hillocks of white breast. Flesh flowing like cream into</p>
<p>them. Strength and length of femur under cotton skirts. Crouching,</p>
<p>submerged, and silent strength.</p>
<p>"Bertha," he said, and touched her lightly on the throat with his</p>
<p>poet's fingers. How she beat there. It ran up his arm in an</p>
<p>ecstasy. "Why Bertha, how you beat--underneath the whiteness."</p>
<p>"I--I----"</p>
<p>"Rollo," called his mother from the euchre table, "your deal, dear.</p>
<p>We're waiting."</p>
<p>"Coming, Mother."</p>
<p>She hated the going sound of his steps, each new faintness of them a</p>
<p>stab.</p>
<p>But her dark forest was full of chimes. Words darted through the</p>
<p>branches with the brilliancy of flamingoes on wing. "Pagan."</p>
<p>"Appassionata." Brooks of the frozen tears of her loneliness began</p>
<p>to flow. She was bursting of music and the sound of the jeweled</p>
<p>words and she wanted to run after him and help him somehow into the</p>
<p>largo of the charmed forest of her heart.</p>
<p>But he was already back at the euchre table and opposite the slim</p>
<p>head that looked as an egg would feel if it came whole out of your</p>
<p>mouth.</p>
<p>Out on the porch it was still again, except for the brook of the</p>
<p>frozen tears.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was very late. Pain in the back of her legs as if the muscles</p>
<p>were screwing. After Rollo's return to the table there had been an</p>
<p>extra round of euchre and extra wines. Three sizes of goblets to be</p>
<p>polished. Mrs. Farley wanted them soaped, bathed, breathed on, and</p>
<p>then shined into nothingness.</p>
<p>Even with the screwing pains, Bertha liked doing them this way in the</p>
<p>stilly part of the night, with the family upstairs and going to and</p>
<p>fro to bed. The warm suds squeaking off. The soft hiss of the</p>
<p>towel. Crystal frozen out of thin laughter. A trayful of the</p>
<p>polite, chittering things. With one stroke she could break them back</p>
<p>into laughter.</p>
<p>Milk bottles to be placed in a row on the kitchen porch and the ice</p>
<p>card to be turned. So.</p>
<p>The shine of magnolias that were no whiter than her feet. Rollo</p>
<p>Farley had touched her; trolled four of his fingers along her</p>
<p>whiteness. They had melted against her throat and down into her</p>
<p>heart. White tapering roads, his fingers, in the dark forest along</p>
<p>which she ran, calling....</p>
<p>Then up the back stairs to her room. It hurt her to climb them. On</p>
<p>the third landing she sat down and let down her balbriggan stocking</p>
<p>to rub at the calf of her leg. It was good, that leg, something that</p>
<p>she could feel in the round. It had dimension. Flesh. Muscle.</p>
<p>Bulge. And when it hurt she could lay her hands to it.</p>
<p>She undressed in the dark, sitting on the bed edge with the door open</p>
<p>for the warmed air of the halls. It was very simple. Waist.</p>
<p>Corsets. Chemise. Smelling strongly clean of laundry soap. Twenty</p>
<p>times a day she washed her arms up to the elbows with the great brown</p>
<p>cakes.</p>
<p>As she sat with her waist half off and the knoll of her first</p>
<p>shoulder shining through, Rollo Farley came to her door. His face</p>
<p>was like a lamp. And hers. Two dim rounds of light, wigwagging.</p>
<p>They lit the fog with the faintness of flame chewing along low wicks.</p>
<p>"I can see you, Bertha, because you are whiter than the darkness is</p>
<p>black."</p>
<p>Her heart shied back and leaped.</p>
<p>"Go away," she said with her lips, but she wanted to turn on her</p>
<p>forest like a music box for him. Wanted her flamingoes to fly, the</p>
<p>sands of the jeweled word-particles to sparkle. He took her hands</p>
<p>and she was ashamed. They were so heavy and lye-bitten and there</p>
<p>were such white ones at her heart that she wanted to give him. Like</p>
<p>his. Pale whispers.</p>
<p>"You don't want me to go away, White Bertha. Why--feel--you have a</p>
<p>little heart in your throat. How it beats."</p>
<p>She began to cry inwardly. There was a little heart in her throat</p>
<p>that beat up against her silence. It was terrible to be dumb. She</p>
<p>could have shrieked, "I am all locked! You hear! Prairies are</p>
<p>flowing in me and oceans and I am under them. Locked!" Words!</p>
<p>Words! To be able to pour some of her jeweled sands on to the</p>
<p>sensitive plate of him. She could feel the sands want to run into</p>
<p>words and the words thunder into wisdom.</p>
<p>"You are so white, Bertha. To think that I never noticed. Deeply</p>
<p>white, like the flesh of a magnolia." She felt her shoulder gleam</p>
<p>and pushed it back into her sleeve.</p>
<p>"Bertha--don't----"</p>
<p>"Go away----"</p>
<p>Then he began shyly at her fingers, lifting them one by one.</p>
<p>"Strong Bertha."</p>
<p>Strong Bertha indeed. Their heaviness sickened her. She wanted to</p>
<p>distract him from their roughness to which the green chiffon always</p>
<p>clung, and to tell him how the lanes of his slender fingers led</p>
<p>through the forest, but what she said was, "Get out. I can bite."</p>
<p>"Then bite, Bertha." The dance of excitement along his whisper! It</p>
<p>set her to trembling. "Your beautiful strength! Give some to me,</p>
<p>White Bertha."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Farley will not have goings-on. Helga will hear. I will call</p>
<p>Mrs. Far-r-ley--"</p>
<p>She gargled the name a little. He looked at her with her face</p>
<p>flattened by darkness into a mere lily pad and her nearness flowed</p>
<p>over him.</p>
<p>"You--who are you? I know! You are the poem of the woman whose feet</p>
<p>are rooted in the secrets out of the soil. You are--you are a----"</p>
<p>"Yes? Yes?"</p>
<p>"You are a--a tower of silence that is buried under some sea. I want</p>
<p>to write you into great oxen words."</p>
<p>Her splayed lips tried, but were dumb. There was something she so</p>
<p>terribly wanted to say to that. A heart hurt. To tell it would be</p>
<p>like giving him a jewel.</p>
<p>"Bertha, you are like a tree when you tremble, caught in a windshake.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid. Come to me--Bertha--close--."</p>
<p>Something had gone over to him. A wraith out of a door. The jeweled</p>
<p>sands were pouring....</p>
<p>"Bertha----"</p>
<p>"No--no--Mrs. Far-r-ley----"</p>
<p>She came down into his arms that had the sudden strength to hold her.</p>
<p>His lips were on her throat, listening.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The days were as days always had been. Entrails of fowls to be torn</p>
<p>out. Mud carried in on grocery boys' heels. "Lawk, spinach boiled</p>
<p>down so!" Pots. Pans. The grease clogging the drain and sucking</p>
<p>the hands. To be ordered:</p>
<p>Bay leaves.</p>
<p>Prepared flour.</p>
<p>Dry mustard.</p>
<p>Kitchen Bouquet.</p>
<p>Silver polish.</p>
<p>Pickled walnuts.</p>
<p>Caraway seeds.</p>
<p>Bottled capers.</p>
<p>Powdered sugar.</p>
<p>Tarragon vinegar.</p>
<p>Just time, fluted into days and nights.</p>
<p>Rollo had not come again. That was part of the preciousness. The</p>
<p>once. The beauty of that hurt more than the pain. Her yearning was</p>
<p>proud of his not coming.</p>
<p>Trust Rollo to pause a little this side of satiety, teased, but with</p>
<p>the flavor high on his palate. Asceticism of keeping a little lean</p>
<p>with self-inflicted hungers.</p>
<p>She had dusted the terra cotta Chloe three of Helga's Thursdays out</p>
<p>and he had not glanced up. He could pass her on the stairs without</p>
<p>seeing, and did. One night, at dinner to ten, wine had warmed him</p>
<p>again, and he came out into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Bertha was tilting an enormous copper pot to drain it of grease, two</p>
<p>fowl shining in it on a device that resembled a spit.</p>
<p>He regarded her through the slippery vapors, her pallor not unlike</p>
<p>the nakedness of the fowl.</p>
<p>_The Cathedral Under the Sea_. He had written it--weeks ago--that</p>
<p>dawn! Hours and hours that he could scarcely account for. The</p>
<p>shaggy manuscript of it in a red portfolio up in the third left</p>
<p>drawer of his desk. A secret palpitating saga that stalked through</p>
<p>forests of iambic and hexameter with the sullen tonnage of a boar.</p>
<p>Jove--up in the third left drawer--must re-write and show it to Beebe.</p>
<p>He went out into the yard for a magnolia. They were asleep on the</p>
<p>tree like birds with tucked heads. Her heart waited. Disks of</p>
<p>poured-off grease riding on the sink water. Her fork stabbing the</p>
<p>softening haunches that were already running juices. The big silence</p>
<p>standing stock still. Hope.</p>
<p>He came in with a bud in his hand that was like a live star. It gave</p>
<p>a little movement forward of a sleepy petal, opening. She wanted</p>
<p>that star for her darkness. Rollo! Like a hoop the silent calling</p>
<p>of his name rolling through the lanes his fingers made in her heart</p>
<p>and yet, when he passed on through the swinging door, there was that</p>
<p>yearning of hers, glad to be again denied.</p>
<p>Baste! Baste! Feeding back into the fowls their own drippings.</p>
<p>Celery to be sharpened at the roots like pencils. A fleck of baking</p>
<p>soda in the peas to bring out the green. Finger rolls warming their</p>
<p>toes at the edge of the oven and Mr. Farley's slice of gluten toast.</p>
<p>Fancy! To be full of the invisible tears of the hurt of beauty all</p>
<p>the while she was toasting old Mr. Farley's slice of diabetic bread.</p>
<p>Hurting gladness.</p>
<p>It was not easy to be glad. Yet Helga was full of gladnesses that</p>
<p>you could almost touch. Dimension and bulge to them, like the calf</p>
<p>of the leg. The easy gladness of Thursday out. "He says to me and I</p>
<p>says to him." Coney Island. "That night watchman's a helluva fresh</p>
<p>guy, but I like him." Swedish Barbecues at Concordia Hall.</p>
<p>Gladnesses that were as easy as spinach. How to capture them the way</p>
<p>Helga did? They ran away from Bertha like little mercury balls.</p>
<p>Once on a Sunday she had gone to a clambake at Knuts Grove, with the</p>
<p>plumber's assistant who came to mend a water pipe. He had pressed</p>
<p>her hips like the ice man, and made her run panting among the trees</p>
<p>and beer kegs. Great big girls with Hogarth expanses of bosom had</p>
<p>sat in rope swings and propelled with their legs until the flounces</p>
<p>flew back and shouts went up to the accompaniment of forefingers</p>
<p>scraping forefingers. "Shame--Oh Shame!" The plumber's assistant</p>
<p>pushed Bertha. High. Higher. Balbriggan legs above laughter. "Let</p>
<p>'er go, Gallagher. Whoops--see! Oh--Oh--that gal's all there!"</p>
<p>Stabs at the pit of her. Helga's gladnesses these. "High! Higher!</p>
<p>It's raining in London! Yah--oh Baby!" Eyes and wet grins all</p>
<p>blurry with beer fumes.</p>
<p>Let the old cat die! The wooden seat tilting and her skirts higher</p>
<p>and her screams full of panic. "I'll yump--let me</p>
<p>out--yah--yah"--slapping right and left and her stocking and shin</p>
<p>torn from the jump--"Yah--you--lunks--you got lice.</p>
<p>Dirty--dirty--youse--dirty--"</p>
<p>She ran then, climbing over fences to find the street car line.</p>
<p>Gladness in the round. What were they compared to the hurting</p>
<p>gladness of Rollo, passing through the kitchen with a breathing star</p>
<p>in his hand? Baste! Baste! Celery to be sharpened. Baste! Then</p>
<p>came the dishing up and the riding of the platters through the</p>
<p>swinging doors on Helga's palm.</p>
<p>Later, much later, with her dish pan turned and the ice card out, she</p>
<p>could see through the crack in the door, the two tables of euchre,</p>
<p>and Rollo and the girl with the dark portières of low hair, left out.</p>
<p>An omission as graceful as the rest between the chords of a prelude.</p>
<p>They were by a fire on a couch that fattened up around them. The</p>
<p>star of a magnolia in her hair, as if it had simply whitened there.</p>
<p>Rollo, nearing her, as he would do it, without seeming to stir. Fine</p>
<p>fettled, both of them, his ears laid back as if to the wind; her</p>
<p>nostrils, little pinks.</p>
<p>Puffs of talk. Silences made loud by heart beats. Her neck back</p>
<p>from the imperceptible nearness of his breathing. Withholding her</p>
<p>young body like an arched bow; his, trembling for the arrow.</p>
<p>They were so young. Crocus tips.</p>
<p>And Bertha, from behind the swinging doors, pinioned to their moment,</p>
<p>her heart trying to pull away from the spike through it.</p>
<p>She in there, who had so little to give and gave that little cannily.</p>
<p>The lovely frugality of thin lips. Bertha back there with her</p>
<p>riches, would have been willing to transfer them from her splayed</p>
<p>lips to the thin ones that he in turn might kiss those riches off----</p>
<p>"Oh, Rollo--Rollo----"</p>
<p>He was feeling for the hair with the magnolia out in it like a star,</p>
<p>but she would tauten back, and finally, on the flip of a despair, he</p>
<p>went out and she remained thrust forward a little to the firelight,</p>
<p>her smile flickering.</p>
<p>In the room beyond the portièred arch, the euchre tables were</p>
<p>shifting. Middle-aged laughter. Silk _froufrous_. The firelight</p>
<p>waiting for Rollo.</p>
<p>After a while he came back. There was a red portfolio under his arm.</p>
<p>She reached out, but he withheld it and opening the shaggy pages</p>
<p>began to read.</p>
<p>Slow oxen words plowing up secrets of the soil. Gleaming submarine</p>
<p>words. Words out of jeweled sands. Heavy words that thundered into</p>
<p>wisdom. The strange wisdom of the silence that stood stock still.</p>
<p>The hexameter of the wide, white feet that the earth sucked unto</p>
<p>herself in fond little marshes, as they ran through the forests</p>
<p>surrounding the Cathedral Under the Sea. The song that was locked in</p>
<p>a heart and hurt there. Rhythm. The fandango of sound. The saga of</p>
<p>the silence of Bertha--there behind the swinging doors, hearing</p>
<p>herself bleed into words. The brook of the frozen tears thawing upon</p>
<p>Rollo's lips. The flamingoes flying----</p>
<p>The oval face was full of tears and so close to Rollo's that</p>
<p>suddenly, over the red portfolio, he had it dry with his kisses, her</p>
<p>body curving back and his curving over it. The flame of winding</p>
<p>arms----</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was late when Bertha went upstairs.</p>
<p>She had polished and twisted twenty-four crystal wine goblets into</p>
<p>nothingness. It was so with her pain. She wanted sullenly to twist</p>
<p>it for twisting her. But it curved away. Nothingness.</p>
<p>It was good to set out the milk bottles. Six in a row. They were so</p>
<p>there. Quarts. Bulge. Dimension.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The magnolia was quite naked. All autumn a circuit of excitement had</p>
<p>been running through the house, ever since a Mr. Beebe, with a</p>
<p>portfolio had interrupted the family at dinner and the mould of</p>
<p>pistachio ice cream had come out uncut and steeped in its own melt.</p>
<p>Day by day the plates coming out from the dining room were more and</p>
<p>more nibbled and nervous-looking. The electric door bell with its</p>
<p>batteries in the kitchen kept tittering. In the front hall the</p>
<p>silver plate for visiting cards was high with them.</p>
<p>There were oatmeal cookies to be baked in daily batches now because</p>
<p>Mrs. Farley, in the gray and jet gown designed for the Daughters of</p>
<p>Confederacy annual luncheon, poured tea every afternoon out of a gold</p>
<p>service that her grandmother had tilted in the same solemn</p>
<p>drawing-room.</p>
<p>Half a dozen of Helga's Thursdays out had been commandeered.</p>
<p>"Fortheluvvaga, you'd think he was making his debutte. Little Lord</p>
<p>Fauntlerollo has written something and it's a helluva sensation. One</p>
<p>of those fresh newspapers guys slipped me something just now for</p>
<p>slipping him up to the study. Fortheluvvaga, I could have tipped</p>
<p>them off to that long ago. I've been emptying that trash basket of</p>
<p>his writings for three years now."</p>
<p>"To write, Helga, is to make words into pack mules to carry fine</p>
<p>thoughts on to paper--if I had the pack mules----"</p>
<p>"Pack mules! Ain't you enough of a pack mule yourself without</p>
<p>wishing for some? Fortheluvvaga, a pack mule wishing for pack mules."</p>
<p>"Pack mules--that wouldn't fall down on their knees----"</p>
<p>"I knew a guy from Missouri once, sold mules. Spondoolaks! That</p>
<p>baby carried four collars in his pocket to a dance and won his lady a</p>
<p>manicure set every time he took 'er to a contest. Little Lord</p>
<p>Fauntlerollo! Say, gimme a baby with liver and lights to him."</p>
<p>Rollo had written something. The white hands at Bertha's heart set</p>
<p>up a fluttering. To write something was not to sprawl prepared flour</p>
<p>and bay leaves on the order list. It was to paint into words and on</p>
<p>to paper the submerged forests of the heart. Like transfer pictures</p>
<p>that you wetted and rubbed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>More pleasant irregularities. Carriages at the curb and the family</p>
<p>barouche at the most untoward of hours. Mr. and Mrs. Farley still</p>
<p>rode out, with a conservatism that even then was beginning to be</p>
<p>conspicuous, in an ink pot of a coupé drawn by two fat bays.</p>
<p>Floundering, gasoline-gagged traffic banes.</p>
<p>Rollo, upstairs, smoking too many cigarettes and flinging out oaths</p>
<p>to the visitors' cards that were slid under his locked study door.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Farley, who came home to luncheon, cutting out newspaper</p>
<p>clippings with his fork and reddening under what seemed more than his</p>
<p>daily allotment of old port. The telephone a screaming cockatoo that</p>
<p>had to be throttled a score of times a day.</p>
<p>"_No, Mr. Rollo Farley cannot be disturbed to come to the telephone.</p>
<p>No, it appeared in four editions of_ New Poetry. _Impossible to get</p>
<p>a copy off the stands any more. Date of book publication December</p>
<p>tenth._"</p>
<p>December tenth. A little knob of a day to stick out of the</p>
<p>flatnesses. Bertha's hopelessness wound around it like a baby's</p>
<p>finger. December tenth. She scoured a whole morningful of pots that</p>
<p>day. Harsh bristles against stove black. Scoured because she was</p>
<p>happy and was happy because she scoured. She was put away, one might</p>
<p>say, like a Christmas-tree-ball. Wadded. Waiting.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It came. A black gusty December tenth of soot on the window sills,</p>
<p>cold door knobs, and when she dumped her scrub water out over the</p>
<p>porch rail, her bare forearms reddened and steamed. Winter. The</p>
<p>magnolia as if a trumped-up bride made out of a poker had been</p>
<p>stripped again down to the poker. She thought of it in bud,</p>
<p>constantly.</p>
<p>The scrub water blew inward as she threw it, lashing her skirts to</p>
<p>her legs. Time for flannels. She must shop new ones for herself at</p>
<p>the Sailors' Supply Store down in Front Street, her first Thursday</p>
<p>out. She liked them man-size with great ribbings at the wrists and</p>
<p>ankles. They kept out soppy water.</p>
<p>She chose of their grossness as naturally as she spat.</p>
<p>December tenth was on a Thursday and Helga as usual was after her.</p>
<p>"Fortheluvvaga, Bertha, have a heart. Gimme your Thursday and I'll</p>
<p>do as much for you. I need stockings. Look at my heel hanging out.</p>
<p>There's a fella down on Fourteenth Street selling them at the curb</p>
<p>for twenty-nine cents. Gimme your Thursday, Bertha, you don't do</p>
<p>nothing with yours nohow but sit and look at it. Aw Berth. I gotta</p>
<p>cold on my chest. How is it they never seem to think the help's</p>
<p>rooms needs heat same as the rest? I need a woolen shirt."</p>
<p>"Yah--Yah--you don't buy warm shirts, you buy thin stockings--all of</p>
<p>you--nothing on the inside of you, so you hang yourselves with things</p>
<p>on the outside.</p>
<p>"Inside! I got a floatin' kidney that's killin' me. I wish you had</p>
<p>my backache for a day."</p>
<p>"That's an ache a plaster can reach."</p>
<p>"Yah, try to lay in bed one morning huggin' a plaster in this house</p>
<p>and see where it gets you. Bein' sick by the clock. Hospital or get</p>
<p>up. My idea of heaven is being sick and taking my time about it.</p>
<p>Aw, Bertha, if you knew how my kidney's hurtin' and I need that</p>
<p>shirt, gimme your Thursday----"</p>
<p>"Yah--yah--always the same. Graft. You got a nerve."</p>
<p>"Aw Berth...!"</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>So Bertha's Thursday out bequeathed to Helga and Bertha at dusting</p>
<p>the study. Rollo's. She could stir the down on the back of his neck</p>
<p>with her breathing as she rubbed at a chair. Shining ridges of book</p>
<p>backs to be dusted. In waves. Thoughts that had found their way out</p>
<p>and into the fragrant prison of morocco. Jeweled sands poured on to</p>
<p>paper. Fleck. Fleck. Mahogany full of pools and one edge of a</p>
<p>table into which Rollo's profile sank--the nostrils, with a little</p>
<p>rabbit-like quiver to them, perpetually upside down. Slow-fingered</p>
<p>firelight, like a neat little girl on a stool, tatting. The rug was</p>
<p>full of colors that were faint as her wisps of old sound. The dust</p>
<p>cloth, an old silk waist of Mrs. Farley's, clung to the rough nap of</p>
<p>her fingers and it hurt her like noise. A room to be quiet in. A</p>
<p>warm kind of a quiet, like a wool shawl over the shoulders. The</p>
<p>pencil whispering and Rollo's hand across his brow like an eye shade.</p>
<p>"Ah me----."</p>
<p>Now, so! To lift that little pad under Rollo's elbow without an oath</p>
<p>from him. There! Lawky, lawk. The rocking horse blotter had a</p>
<p>crystal knob. To reach that now, and to polish it. Done! The stack</p>
<p>of books at his right, half unwrapped. The flare of brown paper to</p>
<p>be removed without a creak. So! Two little stacks of slender books,</p>
<p>rough-leaved and in tawny jackets.</p>
<p>THE CATHEDRAL UNDER THE SEA</p>
<p>BY</p>
<p>ROLLO FARLEY</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>Cathedral-Under-the-Sea-by-Rollo-Farley-the-Cathedral-Under-the-Sea.</p>
<p>Why, to fleck at them with her dust cloth was like touching a bit of</p>
<p>tremor. Her tremor. That figure of a woman on the tawny jacket.</p>
<p>Sullen and at a sea-edge, with the sand sucking tight and eager about</p>
<p>her ankles and the sky like a silence. Jagged leaves which she</p>
<p>opened shyly and with a stealth that trembled.</p>
<p>Wide margins and little islands of printed words. Slow, pulling</p>
<p>words. Arches of rhythm. The naves of her silences. The submerged</p>
<p>grandeurs she had laid to his ear with the roaring shell of her</p>
<p>heart. She had led him down the shelves of these pages, one night,</p>
<p>her friends the soil and the sea-bottoms giving under their feet and</p>
<p>sucking up softly about their ankles.</p>
<p>_The Cathedral Under the Sea!_</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lawk, she had dropped the book, face downward, so that the leaves</p>
<p>doubled up and the ink pot tottered and she barely had time to save</p>
<p>the spill and Rollo was savage.</p>
<p>"Damnation, Helga, leave off your puttering and clear out."</p>
<p>She had risen with the crumpled book to her like a hurt bird and the</p>
<p>blood so furious in her face that it stung his eyes to hers.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you. Of course. Thursday. Run along, there's a girl."</p>
<p>There were a few bank notes on the table, weighted down with loose</p>
<p>change. His hand traveled toward them and then jerked back again,</p>
<p>his attitude listening; his eyes toward their left corners listening;</p>
<p>his dry pen quivering slightly as it, too, hung listening.</p>
<p>Those little book stacks on his desk that her eyes could not veer off</p>
<p>from. Something of him--and of her--there. Herself on the outside</p>
<p>of herself. The broken wing of a book in her arms. Their book. And</p>
<p>yet he sat with his eyes in their corners, waiting for her to go.</p>
<p>"Rollo," cried out her silence, "I am the Cathedral Under the Sea.</p>
<p>Don't you know me?" But all she said was:</p>
<p>"It bane all pencil shavings under your feet. If I could sweep</p>
<p>them..."</p>
<p>At that his fingers where they propped up the pen relaxed to the</p>
<p>page, his eyes sliding from their corners of unease.</p>
<p>"Not now, there's a girl." This time he reached for one of the bills</p>
<p>under the loose change, handing it back to her over one shoulder.</p>
<p>Poor Bertha. An insistent sense of sickness that had been rising in</p>
<p>her of late when she bent over to baste a fowl or scour a floor, came</p>
<p>over her now, almost languidly. A dizzying kind of clutch, as if a</p>
<p>pair of tiny hands were swinging on her heart beat.</p>
<p>"No," she said, standing back from the flutter of the bill.</p>
<p>His eyes flew to their corners again.</p>
<p>"Leave me then. I am busy."</p>
<p>Standing there directly behind him, she forced him to look and her</p>
<p>eyes were crucified.</p>
<p>"I want this."</p>
<p>The crumbled bird of a book. The bent page. The little islands of</p>
<p>jeweled words margined in silence. The beauty of the silence of the</p>
<p>Cathedral Under the Sea. Her silence.</p>
<p>"I want this."</p>
<p>And then when he did not answer and with his look impaled upon hers,</p>
<p>she went out, dizzily, carrying the book, her broom, a floor brush,</p>
<p>and a bottle of furniture oil.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Guests would be in to tea and there were oatmeal cookies to be made,</p>
<p>but she dragged herself up to her room that was trapped under the two</p>
<p>slants of roof. It was good to be up there on her bed. Suddenly and</p>
<p>again that new and fantastic craving irrelevantly had hold of her.</p>
<p>That sense of bud; that desire to behold the leisurely beauty of a</p>
<p>bud opening. The backyard magnolia was stark now. But to see it</p>
<p>bloom! Petals to bow back ceremoniously from calyx. A gesture so</p>
<p>fine that it took place between the battings of an eye. Often and</p>
<p>more often now, that sense of bud opening. Once in her sleep the</p>
<p>soft movement of a petal against the very walls of herself.</p>
<p>A tulip twirling. That was her dizziness. She sat up to shake it</p>
<p>off. Oatmeal cookies to be made....</p>
<p>And then in a flash, seated there on the bed edge, in her silence,</p>
<p>she knew! Knew it dumbly. That tulip twirling had a heart and in</p>
<p>that heart a child. Not his alone, like the book. Theirs!</p>
<p>And her veins were torrents washing and carrying to the bud the wisps</p>
<p>of old sound and the whisperings of her friends, the soils, and the</p>
<p>messages of the chimes, goldily, and the kiss of a poet....</p>
<p>After a while she dragged herself downstairs. Mrs. Farley was</p>
<p>ringing. There were those oatmeal cookies to be made.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marching days of rising in the iced dawn, when the air that came up</p>
<p>from the lower halls was frozen from open windows, while the family</p>
<p>lay deep under fluffy blankets.</p>
<p>Bertha slept with her windows closed, so that her room embalmed the</p>
<p>cold. It ran up her body in great flashes of gooseflesh as she</p>
<p>dressed. Once a week she bathed in a tin tub the shape of a kidney.</p>
<p>She carried the water in eight pitcherfuls from a bathroom two floors</p>
<p>below. The tin tub wobbled as she stood shivering in it, the bottom</p>
<p>denting in and out noisily.</p>
<p>Helga in the adjoining cubicle did not bother. She was a frail girl</p>
<p>with cheek spots of red and at night she fell into bed, often in her</p>
<p>underclothing and stockings, for the additional warmth and for the</p>
<p>additional five minutes of sleep it gave her in the morning, because</p>
<p>then she had only to slip into her black sateen and white organdie</p>
<p>bows.</p>
<p>And for days at a time her bed went unmade. Once, on exploration</p>
<p>bent, Mrs. Farley found it so, plucking very gingerly at the unaired</p>
<p>cotton coverlet. Helga was summoned, and the house-man with a</p>
<p>squirt-can of disinfectant, and scavengers were found nesting in the</p>
<p>slats and Helga, with her nose very red from pinching it to keep back</p>
<p>tears, standing furiously sullen.</p>
<p>"Disgusting. Filthy. Shame, Helga, upon any self-respecting girl.</p>
<p>Dear, oh dear, not fit for a pig. What's that little greasy rag on</p>
<p>the bed? 'Sore toe.' Ugh, what horrid things can happen to the</p>
<p>servant class! Sore toes somehow don't happen to one's</p>
<p>friends--ugh----"</p>
<p>And Bertha, standing at the foot of the stairs listening with one</p>
<p>hand to her cheek, ached in her throat for Helga. She was so young</p>
<p>and there was something so old about the days of dirty chores. They</p>
<p>were like old witches and presently Helga would turn into one of them.</p>
<p>"I wish to God, Mrs. Farley, you knew how it feels to limp around</p>
<p>picking up after you on one of them sore toes!"</p>
<p>Bertha knew, but meekly. Foot torture. The body tiredness at the</p>
<p>end of a seventeen-hour day from stoking the coal range at six A.M.</p>
<p>to placing the two shining apples and a silver pitcher of water</p>
<p>beside the Farley black walnut bedstead at eleven P.M.</p>
<p>And Helga, who waited on table and answered door bells and washed up</p>
<p>bathroom floors and emptied trash baskets and helped the laundress</p>
<p>with the fluted pieces and sat up in the blue bedroom with the</p>
<p>women's wraps during dinners and evening receptions and loved so to</p>
<p>dance with the edge of her strength, knew too, but defiantly.</p>
<p>And that defiance created a servant problem.</p>
<p>Helga, who was shuddering now with tears, could not keep down her</p>
<p>voice.</p>
<p>"You give us dirty holes to live in and expect us to keep 'em pink</p>
<p>and perfumed like your boudoir. Some of the fine folks that come</p>
<p>here to dinner oughtta get a look up here ... they wouldn't have such</p>
<p>a good appetite."</p>
<p>"Helga, you vulgar, horrid girl. I won't be talked to so!"</p>
<p>"Yes, you will. I'm a working girl, but I got my spirit. There's</p>
<p>nothing right about the way the world's run nohow. Those that got</p>
<p>the drudgery to do get the hard beds to sleep on. Those whose bones</p>
<p>are rested from easy living get the soft beds--where's the right of</p>
<p>it, I ask you?"</p>
<p>"Helga, you rude girl, if you don't hush, I'll call my husband."</p>
<p>"Call him. If the men knew the way women treat women in this servant</p>
<p>game, maybe it would help us to get decent living conditions."</p>
<p>"Why, I never had a girl speak to me like this in my life. Every</p>
<p>waitress I ever had in my employ left me only to marry."</p>
<p>"Yah, what's the use changing? Doing one's dirty work is about the</p>
<p>same as doing the next one's."</p>
<p>"Helga!"</p>
<p>"You want us to keep clean, don't you? Like you. Well then, give us</p>
<p>decent rooms and enough time to keep ourselves clean in. Take some</p>
<p>of the show away from the front of the house and give your servants</p>
<p>rooms that are fit to live in."</p>
<p>"My servants' quarters are as good as any."</p>
<p>"Yes, and that's no good. I got a floatin' kidney I have, and I</p>
<p>won't lug bathin' water up two flights of stairs in six pitchers full</p>
<p>for nobody, not even myself. Yes, a floatin' kidney, in case it</p>
<p>ain't polite to have it in your society. Floatin' kidneys don't</p>
<p>happen to your friends. Well, let 'em lug heavy platters like I do</p>
<p>with their right side. Let 'em lug six pitchers of water--No siree,</p>
<p>I won't take cold for nobody, bathing myself in a cast-off old foot</p>
<p>tub that ain't as good as your poodle dog's, and the furnace heat not</p>
<p>even piped up to the fourth story."</p>
<p>"That's no excuse, we take cold showers."</p>
<p>"Yah, because your blood's so sluggish from doin' nothin' that you</p>
<p>got to do somethin' to get it goin'. We don't need to get our blood</p>
<p>to circulating. The rich folks like you keep it circulating for us."</p>
<p>"No self-respecting girl would sleep on----."</p>
<p>"You want me to keep a pretty bed, don't you? Well then, gimme a</p>
<p>decent one to lay on. You drag up here after all day and half the</p>
<p>night on your feet and see if it matters to you if you get into a bed</p>
<p>that's made or unmade. Nobody's got any pink satin covers turned</p>
<p>back for me. We're in luck up here if there's enough servants' linen</p>
<p>to give us a change once a month. When do you expect me to have time</p>
<p>to keep my room like a sachet bag, Mrs. Farley? The eighth day in</p>
<p>the week?"</p>
<p>"Look at Bertha, you rude girl. Immaculate. That proves how</p>
<p>slovenly and ungrateful----."</p>
<p>"Bertha! Aw, she ain't human. She's a dray horse that's so used to</p>
<p>pullin' she can't feel the harness. Bertha! The more work you pile</p>
<p>on her the less time it gives her to sit waiting for time to pass.</p>
<p>She's like a tomb, sitting hard on somethin' to hold it down. Hit</p>
<p>her on the bean and she'll sit there gazing at the stars and not feel</p>
<p>the hurt. I'm human. Bertha's a--hunk."</p>
<p>And Bertha standing at the foot of the back stairs holding her cheek</p>
<p>in a gesture of compassion, heard.</p>
<p>Helga did not leave. Later, Mrs. Farley, who dreaded the employment</p>
<p>agencies, was willing to be placated and Helga, shivering before the</p>
<p>prospect of a luggage laden pilgrimage through the icy streets,</p>
<p>shoved her hand trunk which she had started to pack, back under the</p>
<p>bed, her sobs still jerking in her throat.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A hunk. To be a hunk was to live deeply put away from the sadnesses</p>
<p>and the gladnesses in the round. To be a hunk was to carry a heart</p>
<p>the wonder of whose secret passageways made everything on the</p>
<p>outside, like Coney Island or quinsy sore throat, or Mrs. Farley or</p>
<p>twenty-nine-cent silk stockings, seem not to matter much.</p>
<p>Not to be a hunk was also to crave a great deal for the things on the</p>
<p>outside to matter much. To want so terribly, as Helga could, that</p>
<p>extra Thursday out or dancing slippers with red heels. To be able to</p>
<p>want dancing slippers with red heels, that was not to be a hunk!</p>
<p>All that day of the quarrel, while she washed down the kitchen</p>
<p>woodwork, prepared a clear broth and aspic for Rollo's luncheon, and</p>
<p>cleaned Helga's silver for her while she unpacked her things, she</p>
<p>rolled the word slowly over in her mind. A hunk.</p>
<p>To be a hunk was to carry the secret of the life fluttering at her</p>
<p>walls, without much discomfort. Somewhere, way back in the waste</p>
<p>lands of her consciousness, women had borne child by scarcely more</p>
<p>than pausing beside the plow. Bertha would bear that way, too.</p>
<p>Peasantly.</p>
<p>And so the marching days and the marching weeks and presently the</p>
<p>marching months and Bertha at lugging her bath water the two flights</p>
<p>up, eight times. Heaving coal buckets from the cellar to the kitchen</p>
<p>range. Four turkeys to be prepared for family dinner at Christmas,</p>
<p>her clutch fiery from tearing entrails. At New Year's a baby lamb</p>
<p>was sent from a Vermont Farley, and she drew it and quartered it and</p>
<p>hid a bit of its wool away up in the drawer with the chiffon opera</p>
<p>coat.</p>
<p>She made baby moccasins out of it without any great tenderness. The</p>
<p>pattern troubled her and her underlip hung down with the effort of</p>
<p>turning the tiny corners. But when they were finished one midnight,</p>
<p>and patted out on her knee, a decision, began slowly to harden.</p>
<p>Rollo must know.</p>
<p>Winter was on its last lap. April soon and Rollo must know of the</p>
<p>gift she was bearing. A fluttering of heart-beat at that.</p>
<p>Irrevocably her time was nearing. April soon.</p>
<p>For two months he had been away. Winter flew at his chest and the</p>
<p>first fury of a sleet storm had driven him to Florida. He was home</p>
<p>again now and the city snow packed into corners was getting porous,</p>
<p>and the family at a very private home dinner had enjoyed its first</p>
<p>mess of spring onions daubed in salt and Mrs. Farley, a bantam with</p>
<p>delight at Rollo's return, was constantly now, and unnecessarily, in</p>
<p>and out of the kitchen to sip of his soups, and upon one occasion</p>
<p>tiptoed out in black lace and aigrettes in her hair, to assure</p>
<p>herself that the tenderest portion of mushroom-under-glass was for</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Something slow and something vague was trembling in Bertha at each</p>
<p>sight of Mrs. Farley these days. She dropped pans at the mere</p>
<p>passing of her across the floor of the room above the kitchen, and on</p>
<p>the night that she swept in from her guests in the black lace and</p>
<p>aigrettes, startled, Bertha scalded her forearm in boiling duck</p>
<p>grease.</p>
<p>"Bertha, you clumsy girl! See that Mr. Rollo has this large portion</p>
<p>of the mushrooms. Dip your arm in flour and send the sauterne in</p>
<p>with the fish course."</p>
<p>A secret and booming multiplicity of fears. That tight circle of</p>
<p>faces in there around the dinner table. A closed circle through</p>
<p>which Helga and a hired butler slid in the alien hands of service.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley's face, as out of a Fifth Avenue club window, smugly.</p>
<p>Dowagers sitting broadly and fat with security. The polite face of</p>
<p>an explorer who had once killed his desert comrade for a water</p>
<p>flagon. A lean face impaled on two collar points and engraved in the</p>
<p>steel of the stock exchange. Another face soldered tightly into that</p>
<p>circle of the icy beauty of frugal lips, skin too white for the blood</p>
<p>to shadow, and hair drawn down like portières. Rollo's face with the</p>
<p>singing look of choir boy in it; poignancy of young down on his long</p>
<p>cheeks, lightening of his nervous nostrils.</p>
<p>Fear in Bertha as if the circle could somehow close in and throttle</p>
<p>her. It could make her tremble now, the solidarity of those</p>
<p>alternating black backs and white shoulders.</p>
<p>And then, with spring so perilously near, fear became puny in the</p>
<p>face of imminence.</p>
<p>One evening, long after the family was quiet and the kitchen range</p>
<p>cold, she sat and began to wait. There could be no more putting off.</p>
<p>Rollo must know.</p>
<p>A rare evening of the family early to bed, Helga at the Second Avenue</p>
<p>Dance, Hippodrome--Ladies Free, Rollo dining out. Bertha in the cold</p>
<p>and tidy kitchen, waiting. The octagon-faced wall clock with the</p>
<p>great separate ticks. The first generation of motor cars bleating</p>
<p>their way dimly through the jam of city traffic, out into which she</p>
<p>so seldom ventured. Tick. Tock.</p>
<p>About midnight she began to listen for the creak of wheels against</p>
<p>the curb. Rollo would come home in a hansom.</p>
<p>At one o'clock he arrived and she was already in the front hall when</p>
<p>his key began to twist in the lock.</p>
<p>Rollo must know, but it was as if she were bound and gagged to the</p>
<p>mast of a fast moving craft and could not find the power to cry out</p>
<p>to him when he passed--</p>
<p>"I bane waiting," she said on the top of the little noises he made</p>
<p>entering.</p>
<p>He could take on the blue white of china under fatigue, and his lips</p>
<p>were mauve.</p>
<p>"What the hell----"</p>
<p>She thought at first he was fuddled with wine, and then that it was</p>
<p>the start of seeing her there under the dim hall light. It was a</p>
<p>little of both. Wine went at Rollo with a rush. It befogged him,</p>
<p>but politely. It gave him a caution of movement and a manner. He</p>
<p>felt for the hatrack first, to be sure it was going to be where he</p>
<p>intended hanging his overcoat. He was grandiose, and his evening</p>
<p>shirt full of soft pools from the hall light. Very like a choir boy</p>
<p>with tears in his eyes and very, very careful. He hung up his high</p>
<p>hat so carefully that he caressed it. Not even the hansom driver had</p>
<p>glanced at him twice.</p>
<p>He looked at Bertha as he had always done--since, through a haze of</p>
<p>amazement and a little of the wryness of self-disgust.</p>
<p>He was conscious of a thickened-up fatty look to the center of her</p>
<p>face. He has seen it in moon-hoar and in the plushy darkness of</p>
<p>under an eave. A piggy little swollenness came out in this light,</p>
<p>and her hips curved out with a flatulence that berated him for having</p>
<p>been unfastidious. A great white cow. Uddery. Incredible. He must</p>
<p>have been drunk. Damnably.</p>
<p>Gad, what a mouth, like a catfish gagging on the hook. And yet there</p>
<p>had been a phosphorescence to her body whiteness up there under the</p>
<p>slanting roof. That moment of her in his arms, when suddenly they</p>
<p>were strong enough to hold her. The sullen booming of her</p>
<p>heartbeats, like some faint ocean rolling and tossing over its</p>
<p>treasures. Majestic dissonances. Aspidal choir of voices too remote</p>
<p>to be heard, except with the touch of her flesh singing against his.</p>
<p>_The Cathedral Under the Sea?_ To be sure, he had written it in the</p>
<p>frenzy of that dawn with the lay of that great latent body of hers</p>
<p>still along his.... That crouch of strength behind her silence....</p>
<p>But, ugh, great husky Swede! He must have been drunk--damnably.</p>
<p>"Bertha," he said, on the unwinding of his muffler and so casually</p>
<p>that his words were like so many careful little tin coins dropping,</p>
<p>"isn't it rather late for you to be about?"</p>
<p>The plating on his voice was something against which she suddenly</p>
<p>wanted to hurl herself, smashing through it to those depths of his</p>
<p>being to which she had the right now.</p>
<p>"I bane waiting--for you," she cried, and ran toward the stairs at</p>
<p>him as he placed his foot on the first step. "If you will please</p>
<p>come up--to me, I will tell you something only for you. Please----"</p>
<p>He stood caught, as it were, in the motion of mounting the stairs,</p>
<p>his hand softly white on the curve of banister between them. She</p>
<p>could have crushed her lips to it and kissed her secret down against</p>
<p>it, but she held herself trembling.</p>
<p>"If you will please, Mr. Farley--Rollo--come up to me--please----"</p>
<p>The lymphatic look of cow in her face. The string of gray wool scarf</p>
<p>harsh against her neck. He hated the thought of her chapped hands</p>
<p>unwinding it and catching on the wool with their briary surfaces.</p>
<p>Her buttoned-up waist, concealing her whiteness where he had seen it</p>
<p>one grape-colored night flow down into creamy hillocks of bosom,</p>
<p>spanning her now, too tightly across the bust. How idiotically,</p>
<p>nastily drunk he must have been.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rollo--come----"</p>
<p>"Shame," he said. "A great girl like you. You must be mad. Go to</p>
<p>bed."</p>
<p>She was choking and nailed to the mast of her inarticulateness, he</p>
<p>passed, and as he passed her, with his white hand riding up the</p>
<p>balustrade, she came down on it with her lips, arresting him so that</p>
<p>he jerked it back and shook it from him furiously as if a caterpillar</p>
<p>had crawled there.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rollo--you should know it. I am carrying ... your..."</p>
<p>"For God's sake," he cried, as if he could never have done shaking</p>
<p>his hand of her lip prints, "don't you ever do that again or you'll</p>
<p>have to go. Don't ever come near me. Bah. Here"--and from his</p>
<p>pocket tossed her down a bill and while she stood watching it flutter</p>
<p>he ran upstairs lightly. Then the sound of the key turning in his</p>
<p>door. Lightly.</p>
<p>And suddenly it seemed to her that the silence within her was red</p>
<p>banners and that she must scream them and tear them to shreds and she</p>
<p>ran up the stairs after him, a flight of heavy thumps that ended in a</p>
<p>stumble and, with her fists raised for a frenzied battering against</p>
<p>his closed door, she crumbled up suddenly of black vertigo, into a</p>
<p>heap there on the hall floor.</p>
<p>There was the bill he had fluttered at her, screwed somehow into her</p>
<p>palm and with the remnant of her rage and her strength she began to</p>
<p>tear at it with her teeth, worrying it like a terrier and spitting it</p>
<p>out in shreds.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Dawn found her waiting for it, crouched on her bed edge, where she</p>
<p>had sat five hours with her backache the shape of the stoop of her</p>
<p>spine. The dawns were still very cold. They could come creeping</p>
<p>across the house tops and lie wanly against her eyelids long before</p>
<p>Helga's alarm clock ripped open another day.</p>
<p>There were some shreds of bank note on the floor. She picked them up</p>
<p>and crammed them through the little hole in the pasteboard box that</p>
<p>served her as hair receiver. Her light yellow hair was falling out</p>
<p>in strands now, which she twined around her finger and poked away.</p>
<p>A flower stripping itself to divert the sap to the bud.</p>
<p>Three million dawns creeping over the sills of the vertical city.</p>
<p>Bertha's a lonely iced one that she watched come up like an enemy. A</p>
<p>thin dawn that magnified sound. The milkman crashing down four white</p>
<p>quarts in exchange for the four empty ones. Her heartbeats galloping</p>
<p>against her eardrums.</p>
<p>Rollo must know. Rollo must know.</p>
<p>It was hard to move, because she was stiff from the hours of sitting</p>
<p>in a curve away from the slant of ceiling, but at six o'clock she</p>
<p>must be downstairs to start the range and the servants' breakfast.</p>
<p>At seven, the three morning papers to be taken from the stoop. One</p>
<p>for Mr. Farley beside his breakfast plate in the morning room. One</p>
<p>on Mrs. Farley's breakfast tray beside her hothouse rose. One for</p>
<p>Rollo who did not breakfast at all, softly, outside his room door.</p>
<p>But this morning, his not to be delivered tiptoe as usual. To-day he</p>
<p>must know. A whole string of quick rappings, too low to be heard by</p>
<p>Mrs. Farley across the hall, but if need be, a rattling of the door</p>
<p>knob, and then through the first slit of the door opening, her toe</p>
<p>for a wedge, and in.</p>
<p>Oh, God, Rollo must know. Rollo must know.</p>
<p>What if Helga should notice? When Helga tittered it was like a mouse</p>
<p>running up your leg. And Mrs. Farley. She began to cry with the</p>
<p>sense of her growing hulk and fear. Cymbals of it crashing through</p>
<p>her! Fear of Mrs. Farley and yet she came bearing gifts in the flesh</p>
<p>of her flesh.</p>
<p>The tears lay to her cheeks and chapped there. She poured water into</p>
<p>her bowl, plunging handfuls against her face and drying on her gray</p>
<p>flannel petticoat. There were not always towels. After a while it</p>
<p>was half after five and she could venture down, softly to save the</p>
<p>creaks.</p>
<p>It was easier, somehow, waiting in the kitchen. Kindlier. But a</p>
<p>chill smote her when she took in the milk bottles so that she sat</p>
<p>down suddenly. The horridness of these mornings. The full-throated</p>
<p>kind of sickness that could turn her whiteness sea-green.</p>
<p>But only for an instant. There were the coals to be hauled up from</p>
<p>the cellar and the fire to be laid. The coffee mill locked in the</p>
<p>vise of her knees and set whirring at top speed. Bacon to be</p>
<p>parboiled and the servants' mess of warmed-over oatmeal softening its</p>
<p>crust in the double boiler. The ice pan to be heaved sink high and</p>
<p>emptied. Slops. Nibbled down asparagus ends smelling sourly down</p>
<p>into last night's casaba melon rinds.</p>
<p>At half past six Helga came down adjusting the criss-crosses of</p>
<p>organdie apron strips and tasting her lips as if they were bitter.</p>
<p>She was swollen and her lids granulated with sleep, and she coughed</p>
<p>with a certain pride in the depths of its croupiness.</p>
<p>She started her day tired. Bone tired. She could almost have gone</p>
<p>to sleep standing there, croupily coughing.</p>
<p>"You've got a cold, Helga. Shame. Running to the dance halls and</p>
<p>the gin parlors all night."</p>
<p>"What'll I do? Entertain the fellas in the drawing-room? She won't</p>
<p>even give 'em kitchen room. Helluva chance for a fella with insides</p>
<p>to him to want to cuddle a girl in the wintry breezes of Gramercy</p>
<p>Park. The gate to that's even locked against us. Where does a girl</p>
<p>get off, I'd like to know. It's either the gin parlors with them or</p>
<p>sneaking them up to bed with her."</p>
<p>"Here's your breakfast. It'll warm you."</p>
<p>"Fortheluvvaga, warmed-over oatmeal again. I can't swallow the</p>
<p>stuff. I wishtaga I could poke it down her throat, lumps and all,</p>
<p>and learn her that the Lord didn't line her stomach no different than</p>
<p>mine."</p>
<p>He lined stomachs and made the magnolia to bloom and He sat on a</p>
<p>throne drenched with Light. Sometimes it seemed to Bertha that a</p>
<p>little drench of the Light was on her.</p>
<p>Oh Lord. Lord. Rollo. Help me. Rollo must know. Help me to make</p>
<p>Rollo know.</p>
<p>"Fortheluvva. This oleo is strong enough to walk. Gimme a snack of</p>
<p>little Lord Fauntrollo's sweet butter, Bertha. This stuff don't</p>
<p>slide down me no easier than it would down him. Here Berth--where</p>
<p>you goin'?"</p>
<p>But it was striking seven and down the length of hallway Bertha was</p>
<p>already opening the front door. Grayness of Gramercy Park. Trees in</p>
<p>bare black and rheumatic twists. Fourth Avenue's lean, tall office</p>
<p>buildings already breathing down in packs upon the little square of</p>
<p>Park, wolfish to invade.</p>
<p>The morning papers in little huddle against the storm door. Three.</p>
<p>She carried Rollo's upstairs. It was very still outside his door.</p>
<p>It was as if, almost, the very door were saturated with a night of</p>
<p>his breathings. She could hurt it by twisting the knob. If she</p>
<p>rapped the panels might give a little under her knuckles, like flesh.</p>
<p>It was hard bracing herself for the string of quick low rappings, her</p>
<p>toe set for the wedge in the opening....</p>
<p>Imperative raps. Rollo must know. But her arm was too limp and the</p>
<p>tears kept running down into her mouth and splotched right down on to</p>
<p>his morning paper.</p>
<p>Rollo's paper. She wiped them off with her elbow. They had</p>
<p>spattered a picture. A woman's photograph looking up at her from the</p>
<p>first page of the morning paper. Long low portières of hair and a</p>
<p>head shaped as an egg would feel if it came whole out of your mouth.</p>
<p>"_Miss Veronica Stedman Neidringhouse, one of the past season's most</p>
<p>popular debutantes, whose engagement to H. Rollo Farley, the poet,</p>
<p>and only son of Mr. and Mrs. H. Freilinger Farley of Cramercy Park,</p>
<p>is announced. The wedding will be one of the events of early</p>
<p>summer._"</p>
<p>Suddenly the big silence standing stock still again. It was so hard</p>
<p>to feel, except dimly, and all the little tumults and the little</p>
<p>hopes and even the fears, were back now in their branches chirruping</p>
<p>in a sleepy sort of dusk. A dusk that was stunned. A dusk in which</p>
<p>a pain had died. It was good to be without pain and back in the dim</p>
<p>quiet.</p>
<p>The newspaper now to be folded squarely over the tear splotches and</p>
<p>left leaning so that when Rollo opened his door presently it would</p>
<p>fall toward. It was merely a chore again. Part of the day's mute</p>
<p>doing of mute things.</p>
<p>The oatmeal was scorching and her nostrils flared. It was</p>
<p>instinctive for her to start to rush down, which she did, catching</p>
<p>herself back by the balustrade.</p>
<p>Rollo must not know.</p>
<p>The morning was a grave and that moment outside his door a flower</p>
<p>upon it. Everything was so simple because it was so quiet. She</p>
<p>loved that, because it was the kind through which the chimes, if they</p>
<p>would, might come through, goldily again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Upstairs it was still cold, and when she stooped to drag out her</p>
<p>outlandish carpetbag from under the bed, her breath was illuminated.</p>
<p>There was not much to pack. A suit of the man-size underwear to be</p>
<p>folded over bulkily. A pair of black buttoned shoes with scalloped</p>
<p>tops. The green chiffon coat and the oddments of crystal stars.</p>
<p>Balbriggan stockings.</p>
<p>Some sheet music that had come down to the kitchen from time to time</p>
<p>included with the colored supplement of the Sunday paper. It was</p>
<p>pleasant to ride with the eye along the ups and downs of the frozen</p>
<p>rhythm. Her piece of Bulgarian embroidery. The concertina. A large</p>
<p>greenish glass marble she had found once in a rubbish heap, a</p>
<p>beautiful spiral of candy stripe down its center. Quite a wad of</p>
<p>saved wages sewed into the pocket of a red flannel petticoat. Her</p>
<p>bit of tremor, _The Cathedral Under the Sea_.</p>
<p>Poor Bertha, her face could look out so cleanly and whitely and as</p>
<p>uncluttered as a nun's from the little three-cornered shawl she wore</p>
<p>sometimes against neuralgia when she sat out on the bit of back</p>
<p>porch. But in her slab of hat, with its trumped-up rose on a wire</p>
<p>stem, it became broader than long in a comedy squat.</p>
<p>Then her cloak. A discarded black Inverness cape of Mr. Farley's,</p>
<p>that she had bought back from the dealer who came semiannually, as he</p>
<p>was going out the kitchen way. A black broadcloth that boxed her in</p>
<p>squarely, the shoulders horizontal and two inches wider than her own.</p>
<p>There was a look of steerage about Bertha, who had never tasted the</p>
<p>sea except from Front Street. A bit of Old World flotsam flung into</p>
<p>New World jetsam and drifting along into fantastic amalgam.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Helga, who had actually come over in a ship little</p>
<p>larger than a trawl, bareheaded, shawled, and with a bundle of</p>
<p>strange foods wrapped in a Swedish newspaper, now wore high heels,</p>
<p>half-silk stockings, and a small hat so American that it completely</p>
<p>obliterated one eye.</p>
<p>There were no old sounds coming through to trouble Helga and hurt of</p>
<p>their imprisonment. Her heart was not a harp for them. Indeed, it</p>
<p>was good not to be a hunk.</p>
<p>Helga had learned to bunny-hug in the Hippodrome Dance Hall down on</p>
<p>Second Avenue, Ladies Free. Brilliantly lit egress from the long</p>
<p>hours and the bearing down kidney pains. Pomaded men whose hands</p>
<p>sweated through her shirtwaist danced there. She had gone to an</p>
<p>hotel with one of them, sneaking in and up the Farley back stairs at</p>
<p>five one morning with her shoes in her hand. He was a masseur in a</p>
<p>Broadway hotel. A Swedish girl she knew had forced one to marry her</p>
<p>that way. Frightening him with lies about a baby. Helga would go</p>
<p>with her masseur again. Maybe if she were lucky she would "get</p>
<p>caught." If not--if not, if one was clever like some, one could</p>
<p>frighten a man into marriage. Helga was tired; bone tired and wanted</p>
<p>a home. Oh yes, Helga had assimilated.</p>
<p>Her door was open as Bertha went out with her bag. Her bed unmade,</p>
<p>the sheets still in the writhe of her tangled sleep. The halls were</p>
<p>lighter now, the newspaper still leaning against Rollo's closed door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Farley by means of a pink enamel bell that hung over her bed was</p>
<p>ringing for her morning cup of hot water. Helga would pour it and</p>
<p>carry it up on a silver tray. Now was Bertha's time while Helga was</p>
<p>pouring.</p>
<p>It was rather strange going out through the front door and facing the</p>
<p>Park from the eminence of the stoop. She was accustomed to emerge</p>
<p>from the side entrance on a level with the sod.</p>
<p>It was six years and a half since she had changed places. Old dreads</p>
<p>came flowing back. The Hungarian with short thick stumps for fingers</p>
<p>who made her sign papers. Questions to be answered. Talk. New ways</p>
<p>for old. You sat like a piece of cattle in a little fenced-off pen</p>
<p>in the Intelligence Office. Waiting. Sometimes while you were being</p>
<p>inspected, very closely, needles came out all over you and stung.</p>
<p>Once a man had said laughingly to his wife, "Look at her teeth, too."</p>
<p>That same woman had taken her directly from the Intelligence Office</p>
<p>to her home. A handsome woman in a Persian lamb coat and lorgnettes,</p>
<p>and the apartment on Broadway and Fifty-third Street was fine and new</p>
<p>with a drawing-room hung in mulberry and light green. Apple orchards</p>
<p>in June. But the servant's room was in the basement and half the</p>
<p>floor covered with water that had backed from a drain. A kitten lay</p>
<p>drowned in it. At midnight, without having undressed, Bertha took</p>
<p>silent departure, traveling by elevated train down to the Front</p>
<p>Street rooming house where her foster mother and a Danish sailor sat</p>
<p>in a back room stewing in gin.</p>
<p>Old dreads. The lugging of the carpetbag into strange rear</p>
<p>entrances. Strange pots and pans and palates. A family of rich</p>
<p>Greeks on Madison Avenue had been kind, but the seasoning and the</p>
<p>swim of olive oil sickened her. New waitresses to be encountered.</p>
<p>They were a sniggering lot, often with filthy habits, such as drying</p>
<p>the tumblers on the hand-towel, or sneaking up a bit of French pastry</p>
<p>from the pantry to let it mould and draw vermin on a clothes closet</p>
<p>shelf. One of them had once stolen Bertha's purse with her month's</p>
<p>wages in it.</p>
<p>The thumbed-up old references to be dug up. And again drearily:</p>
<p>"Every other Thursday out, you understand? Things fumigated. Grown</p>
<p>daughter--no men in kitchen."</p>
<p>It was as if she had stepped out of the house into a swarm of these</p>
<p>stinging recollections.</p>
<p>The postman was coming up the stoop as she went down, and she had</p>
<p>almost to run and turn quickly to the east against Helga's imminent</p>
<p>answering to his ring.</p>
<p>It was dirty with old snow on Third avenue, but there was the smell</p>
<p>of melt in the air, and underneath the elevated structure the street</p>
<p>ran with mud the color and consistency of a chocolate sauce.</p>
<p>The city, shuddering in its perpetual nervous chill of trucks over</p>
<p>cobblestones, and elevated railroads, could always befuddle her.</p>
<p>To-day it spun around her like a plate on a juggler's stick. Blurs</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>Knut's Intelligence Office was on Second Avenue and First Street.</p>
<p>She turned toward it. But no--not now--dizzy--where--what now?</p>
<p>It was suddenly easier to walk four blocks and board a bobtailed</p>
<p>southbound car. A little sign swung over the motorman. Front Street.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Annie Wennerberg. For twenty-eight years she had lived near bilge</p>
<p>water in a street that wound back from the harbor as crookedly as a</p>
<p>sailor's stagger. She neither knew the sea nor loved it, but its</p>
<p>stench, with the salt tang strangely out of it, was in the hallways</p>
<p>of her lodging house and she tasted it in the beard of stokers who</p>
<p>kissed her when they were drunk enough. Drunk enough, because this</p>
<p>side of bestiality even stokers were fastidious of her soot-filled</p>
<p>pores and furious pockings. Tripe. There was that kind of</p>
<p>sponginess to the cheek of Annie Wennerberg.</p>
<p>But to men glutted with sea and half daft with the stare of sky,</p>
<p>there was land cheer in Annie's basement dining room, with the red</p>
<p>bows wrapped around the throats of the two china vases on a shelf and</p>
<p>where one could stew in gin slowly and warmly. Sailors could find</p>
<p>letters waiting for them there, too, on the hall rack. Sometimes</p>
<p>they were months, even years old, grimy with waiting and fantastic</p>
<p>with foreign stamps.</p>
<p>On those brief and intermittent occasions when she was out of work,</p>
<p>Bertha slept on a carpet-covered sofa in the basement kitchen.</p>
<p>Curious rather sinister nights of great clod-boots walking none too</p>
<p>evenly through the black uncarpeted halls. Sailor badinage in the</p>
<p>dining room..</p>
<p>One night, a ship's dishwasher off a big twin-screw trans-atlantic,</p>
<p>sleeping with five sailors in a second-story room set up such a</p>
<p>howling of delirium tremens that an ambulance, clanging into the lane</p>
<p>of Front Street, had borne him off finally, biting and wrestling with</p>
<p>two internes, a policeman, and Bertha.</p>
<p>Front Street, rancid with sea sculch. Sailors with red threads in</p>
<p>their eyeballs two hours after they had come ashore. The women in</p>
<p>dreadful finery who preyed upon them. Men of all yellows. Malay.</p>
<p>East Indian. Chinese. Javanese. Cooks. Stokers. Mates.</p>
<p>Stowaways.</p>
<p>It was fantastic down on Front Street, but not to Bertha who had</p>
<p>grown up in it. Annie, who breathed great gin-smelling bubbles when</p>
<p>she slept. Public schools where the cross-breeding of white skin and</p>
<p>slant eyes was frequent, and little boys and little girls knew</p>
<p>horrible lurking things. At eight, Bertha had worn a hat pin under</p>
<p>her waist against the bestiality of lodgers.</p>
<p>So when Bertha turned her face once more toward Front Street, she</p>
<p>knew why. Annie charged her fifteen cents the night on the</p>
<p>carpet-covered sofa. And no talk. Annie never cared enough to ask</p>
<p>questions. Besides, year by year now her hearing was failing and she</p>
<p>was usually pretty sleepy. Gin-soaked.</p>
<p>When Bertha arrived with her carpetbag, Annie was in the sort of</p>
<p>combination kitchen and keg-room, sucking up coffee out of a tin cup,</p>
<p>a bottle by.</p>
<p>"I bane outtava yob," said Bertha and showed her carpetbag under the</p>
<p>sofa.</p>
<p>"Fired?" asked Annie, who had not heard her.</p>
<p>"Quit."</p>
<p>"There's coffee," said Annie, who charged her five cents a cup and</p>
<p>rose out of the huddle of herself, to remove a lot of dirty-looking</p>
<p>rags from the sofa. A small exotic breed of South American monkey</p>
<p>leaped out of them and skittered across the floor, making a noise</p>
<p>like a boy running a stick along a picket fence.</p>
<p>An old Australian stoker off a fruit steamer who owned Annie, owned</p>
<p>him, too. In the act of picking off the rags and cleaning the sofa</p>
<p>of some of its debris, Annie suddenly began to limp, her hand back in</p>
<p>a plaster over the small of her back.</p>
<p>"There's ten cots to be made up this morning, Berthy. Three</p>
<p>freighters came in last night and they're sleeping all over</p>
<p>themselves upstairs. I'm breaking in two of the twinges, Berthy, and</p>
<p>ten cots to be made ... and the hallways, with me crippled up my</p>
<p>back, rotting of dirt."</p>
<p>Sly old Annie. There were chores to be had out of Bertha, gratis,</p>
<p>and she knew it. The last time between jobs, she had scrubbed three</p>
<p>flights of stairs, the roaches scurrying over her hands. Bertha did</p>
<p>not mind. It was easier than to sit and look at the furtive silence</p>
<p>of Annie's house. She did not drink and the men knew she would jab</p>
<p>them with hatpins.</p>
<p>"Hunky Dory," they called her, and "Milksop" and "Wench," and</p>
<p>occasionally when an uninitiated one sprang out on her from a dark</p>
<p>corner and with wet lips, she stabbed in deep and ruthlessly.</p>
<p>So usually in these intervals, she would work for Annie. Dirty</p>
<p>chores, with her skirts pinned back, her feet bare, and her great</p>
<p>white arms plunged to the elbow in dirty waters.</p>
<p>But not this time. "No, I bane going out," she said, stooping to</p>
<p>unclutch the hand of the little monkey from the hem of her skirt and</p>
<p>tossing him a small potato from a mound of them in the sink, "I got</p>
<p>to go."</p>
<p>Annie began to sop bread in her coffee, chewing it along her empty</p>
<p>gums. In her bloaty, befogged way she hated Bertha. Always had.</p>
<p>She had cuffed her constantly as a child and the burr of an old</p>
<p>couplet still clung:</p>
<p>Born of a dead mother</p>
<p>Secrets of the grave you'll utter.</p>
<p>Great silent clod of a Bertha, it was as if she were spreading her</p>
<p>skirts not to reveal the bones of eternities of dead men's</p>
<p>thoughts--lying bleaching on the fields of her silence.</p>
<p>"Slut," said Annie without glancing up from her cup. Annie's</p>
<p>toad-like words, sometimes they jumped out in her sleep.</p>
<p>Strange that they had never more than jounced off Bertha, although</p>
<p>all of her formative days had been lived in a hailstorm of them. Her</p>
<p>body was like a white fog, surrounding the imperviousness of her.</p>
<p>That, too, was why she could scrape drain holes to a sense of goldy</p>
<p>rhythm. That was why she could go out now, with a word like "slut"</p>
<p>hurled impenetrably at her back.</p>
<p>The sun was shining outside, and the air from the hay and feed store</p>
<p>next door, full of warm fertilizing smells.</p>
<p>She stood irresolute at the door watching the little dribbly life of</p>
<p>the street. A suit of men's jumpers dangling on a pole before the</p>
<p>Sailors' Supply Store flopped like a man on a gibbet. A marine came</p>
<p>out of a lean house and turned recklessly left. A few moments later</p>
<p>one of the women of dreadful finery came out of the same house and</p>
<p>turned cautiously right. A pair of handsome dray horses were led</p>
<p>from a stable down a wooden incline to the street and stood there</p>
<p>being harnessed. There were hoots from tugs and long-drawn whistles</p>
<p>that seemed to leave a trail of smoke across the morning.</p>
<p>After a while Bertha began to walk. Without destination. At Battery</p>
<p>Park where the city bows to the sea, she sat down on a bench. How it</p>
<p>beat, that ocean, even in the trapped harbor, over its treasures.</p>
<p>Bertha beating, too, over hers.</p>
<p>The day wore on. There were children shrilling up and down the</p>
<p>curves of granatoid walks and clumps of shawled women and bearded men</p>
<p>all very much concerned and fiery with foreign languages. A pier</p>
<p>house kept disgorging little emigrant tribes from Ellis Island, their</p>
<p>skins sun and wind beaten, and lugging, most of them, carpetbags.</p>
<p>Like Bertha's. The tired yield of tired countries.</p>
<p>At five o'clock it grew chilly and because her legs were growing numb</p>
<p>Bertha began to walk again, stopping at a caravan on wheels with a</p>
<p>short ladder leading up to it, to eat two sausage sandwiches, washing</p>
<p>them down with the East Side's favorite soft drink of celery tonic.</p>
<p>The streets were lighted by then and she began to walk again, on and</p>
<p>on. Poor streets made kindly by the glow from petty shops.</p>
<p>Bertha, who expected nothing, had lost nothing, and yet, in the</p>
<p>impotence of her dumb, hurting misery, she could have battered down</p>
<p>closed doors for relief, jabbed at her arms and body with jagged</p>
<p>stones, bitten down into her tongue, which she did and it bled.</p>
<p>It helped somehow to hurry along gaunt and boxed into her cape. To</p>
<p>hurry and to hurry--alone, in her silence spangled with tears.</p>
<p>It was long past midnight when she finally rounded again into Front</p>
<p>Street. There were drunks about, but no one molested her. On the</p>
<p>contrary, they reeled rather away. Her face, fatty white, like jade,</p>
<p>was so square, so riveted in its pain.</p>
<p>The hall was dead dark, a fitting lurchway for inflamed seamen.</p>
<p>There was a seam of light beneath the dining-room door and a silence</p>
<p>all corduroyed with snores. Annie and a Lithuanian sailor were</p>
<p>asleep in their chairs, two bottles between them, her head and tongue</p>
<p>lolling and he sleeping down into his beard. Sots. It was like</p>
<p>looking in on a nightmare. Annie with her empty gums and breathing</p>
<p>her bubbles.</p>
<p>It was dark in the kitchen, but without even benefit of the gas jet</p>
<p>which was hard to reach, or the candle in a bottle on the sink,</p>
<p>Bertha dragged the table across the door, barricading it and then</p>
<p>piled it with an additional chair. The monkey leaped off the couch</p>
<p>chittering, as fully dressed she lay down on it, spreading the</p>
<p>Inverness cape for coverlet. He was a nervous little thing and sat</p>
<p>huddling in a corner looking through the darkness at her with lit</p>
<p>eyes. Amber tunnels.</p>
<p>"Yockie," she whispered, glad for those two phosphorescent disks in</p>
<p>her darkness, "Yockie, yump up here." Finally he did, curling up in</p>
<p>the crook of her elbow for warmth.</p>
<p>She lay with him that way all night, until her arms went numb and her</p>
<p>fingers began to lose their sense of separateness.</p>
<p>But Jocko had ceased trembling and was asleep and to move would have</p>
<p>been to awaken him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Weeks of sitting six hours a day, in the railed pens of this and that</p>
<p>employment agency, the wad of savings in her petticoat-pocket</p>
<p>flattening. Long hours of women hesitating sometimes very long over</p>
<p>her and then passing on.</p>
<p>One rather elderly matron in sealskin could not seem to get by her.</p>
<p>"You appear such a strong, clean European sort of girl. I'm sure</p>
<p>you'll do very nicely. No. No. I can't seem to quite decide.</p>
<p>I--well I don't know. I'll think it over."</p>
<p>A woman from Lexington Avenue dickered between Bertha and a Lettish</p>
<p>girl at great length, finally deciding in favor of the latter.</p>
<p>A housekeeper engaging a new staff of servants for a Fifth Avenue</p>
<p>menage hired her in one breath and changed her mind in the next.</p>
<p>Behind the fatted mask of her imperturbability, a fear smote Bertha.</p>
<p>The sisterhood's long nose of intuition was beginning to quiver at</p>
<p>the flanges.</p>
<p>Then one night down in Front Street, Annie, brewing herself a stew of</p>
<p>lamb neck and regarding Bertha, began to squint up slyly, a word that</p>
<p>was horrible hopping off her lips. Then Bertha knew for certain.</p>
<p>After all, it was to be expected. March had already turned the</p>
<p>corner. The eyes of the appraising women, focusing slightly, were</p>
<p>beginning to suspect. And now Annie, soaked old hex, but wise in</p>
<p>this from being a woman, dropping that hop-toad word.</p>
<p>"You bane one yourself," said Bertha back at her this time, trembling</p>
<p>in her boxed cape, turning and walking out of the house. Walking and</p>
<p>wanting again in her unassailed strength the relief of hurling down</p>
<p>doors and hacking at herself with stones for the relief of pain.</p>
<p>Rollo, help. Lord, drenched in Light, help.</p>
<p>Then again hours and hours of sitting in Battery Park watching the</p>
<p>harbor waves, like lips, running out to the horizon to tell sky.</p>
<p>Sky. The statue of Liberty pointing to it. Steamers hooting to it.</p>
<p>Street cars crawling under it. Grass pointing toward it. A swimming</p>
<p>sense of infinitude that drowned her finally into a state of quiet,</p>
<p>and her pain went out like a match.</p>
<p>One day in a Delancy Street employment agency she obtained a job.</p>
<p>Charwoman. Night work in one of those lower Broadway office</p>
<p>buildings that house by day a vertical city of four thousand</p>
<p>honeycombed, bumbling souls.</p>
<p>The woman with the drooping busts and machine stitched wig who</p>
<p>conducted the intelligence office, had been sly about it.</p>
<p>"Say, for who sees you at night, you don't got to worry. In such a</p>
<p>deserted office building like the Equitable, such a strong,</p>
<p>healthy-looking girl like you should keep such a job until the last</p>
<p>day."</p>
<p>Silent, tiled corridors, lavatories, elevators, and fire-proof stairs</p>
<p>to be swabbed. Nights fitful with these mopping char-women weaving</p>
<p>their long strokes through the long, long corridors. A battalion of</p>
<p>witches of Endor. Women with old pools of eyes that were gathering</p>
<p>scum. Crooked backs. Empty gums.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock they met with pails and mops, an army of the silent</p>
<p>dead flitting through corridors and gathering up the footsteps that</p>
<p>men leave after them. Ghouls preying upon the death of a day. At</p>
<p>dawn they faded out again. Grayly. Gray into gray.</p>
<p>To Bertha, mopping, mopping through these corridors of the night, it</p>
<p>was as if her scrub water, as it blackened, became alive with</p>
<p>vibrations. Nervous floors still beating with men's anxious</p>
<p>hastenings hither and thither. Whither? Squnching her mop in the</p>
<p>bucket, the water crowded up thirstily around her wrists, like a</p>
<p>mouth.</p>
<p>And then it was pleasant walking home before the city got its</p>
<p>stranglehold on the day. There was a graveyard in lovely and</p>
<p>impregnable tranquillity around Trinity Church, its silence louder</p>
<p>than the typhoon of men that raged about it all day. Sometimes</p>
<p>Bertha sat down against a headstone. Between two deaths. The little</p>
<p>death before life that she was carrying. The tired death after life</p>
<p>beneath the slabs.</p>
<p>Presently the death that Bertha had under her heart would be born</p>
<p>into life. The little life of a little death. And under the slabs</p>
<p>the death of a life. Life of death. Death of life. A cycle of</p>
<p>perceptions twirling slowly in her consciousness. Not thoughts, just</p>
<p>a slow kind of dizziness.</p>
<p>She dozed a great deal. Against the headstones. In parks. On the</p>
<p>carpet-sofa in Annie's kitchen. Waiting. It was good to be working</p>
<p>nights and rid of the fear of the sailor-infested darkness of Front</p>
<p>Street. Days, with Annie bickering about, no matter how gin-soaked,</p>
<p>there was more security to lying stretched out on the carpet sofa</p>
<p>under the Inverness cape, Jocko trembling to her for warmth.</p>
<p>One night, swabbing up a tenth floor corridor of the Equitable</p>
<p>Building, a pain smote at Bertha that caused her to cry out and</p>
<p>clutch at herself, as if someone were trying to shove her off the top</p>
<p>of a skyscraper. A leap of forked lightning that went through her</p>
<p>like a jagged grin of steel....</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later in the ambulance on her way to city hospital,</p>
<p>her baby was born. Painlessly. So without labor that the internes</p>
<p>joked and told about it at experience clinics.</p>
<p>A son. The music of the chimes goldily tranced in his eyes. Tranced</p>
<p>there, like the candy strip down the glass marble in her carpetbag.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Bertha's boy was two and one half weeks old she signed him away,</p>
<p>sprawlingly, as she would write, "prepared flour" and trying, with</p>
<p>her left fingers about right wrist, to keep her hand to the dotted</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>A lawyer with a brief case on the desk beside her sucked up with a</p>
<p>blotter the symbol of her deed. Ellen Dike Bixby. John Kendall</p>
<p>Bixby, Detroit, Michigan, added their respective signatures. A nurse</p>
<p>from Bertha's ward stood by and signed as witness. The champ of a</p>
<p>seal. More blotting.</p>
<p>"There," said the lawyer passing around the folded documents and</p>
<p>beginning to buckle up his brief case. "That's that."</p>
<p>He was like a clamp on a coffin lid and Bertha wanted to cry out</p>
<p>against him, but she only stood very still holding her document.</p>
<p>"Well, my girl, what you have done is very sensible. You are not in</p>
<p>a position to provide properly for the boy and you are placing him in</p>
<p>the hands of two very splendid and trustworthy people, who by legal</p>
<p>adoption have just now become his parents. You are a very fortunate</p>
<p>girl. Mr. and Mrs. Bixby can give him the refinements and the</p>
<p>opportunities of a beautiful home and the best of educational</p>
<p>advantages. So my girl, instead of feeling unhappy, you should</p>
<p>regard yourself as the object of congratulations."</p>
<p>Her throat hurt from holding down moans. There were little red glass</p>
<p>mulberries on Mrs. Bixby's hat. Such a pretty hat and her face was</p>
<p>plumpish and fresh, and her hand constantly in sympathy on Bertha's.</p>
<p>"We will be father and mother to him, dear. He will never know the</p>
<p>difference. You see this--to-day is the fifth anniversary of our--of</p>
<p>our little one being taken from us. That's why your little</p>
<p>one--ours--his beauty is so like--like--our--little boy's--was--"</p>
<p>"Go. Go," cried the moans in Bertha's throat, caught there like a</p>
<p>log jam, "Go. Go."</p>
<p>Mr. Bixby had short clipped hair and carried a well-brushed derby hat</p>
<p>and wore a tiny Masonic emblem on his lapel.</p>
<p>"Good-by," he said, and "Thank you and God bless you."</p>
<p>"Umph," said the lawyer and followed them out.</p>
<p>Then the moans came. Terribly. Once a dog, run over by a truck in</p>
<p>Front Street, had moaned like that. The unwetted sobbings of one who</p>
<p>does not know how to cry.</p>
<p>The little nurse who was left alone with her was kind and soothed her</p>
<p>with chirruping noises, and poured some spirits of ammonia into a</p>
<p>glass of water, which Bertha drank at a gulp and then smarted with</p>
<p>tears. But she could not stop moaning and shivering, and kept</p>
<p>sitting and clinging to her corner like a dumb animal that had been</p>
<p>hurt.</p>
<p>Finally a young interne was sent for and he came in and gave her</p>
<p>something brown and bitter, and although she had been discharged from</p>
<p>the ward that day, between him and the nurse they led her back,</p>
<p>chattering and shivering and shuddering, little streaks of foam out</p>
<p>along her lips.</p>
<p>The nurse was very young and the interne, too, and Bertha's kind of</p>
<p>story was very old, and so they did the properly sedative things, but</p>
<p>their eyes kept curving around the dull reality of their charge for</p>
<p>the wonder of one another.</p>
<p>All night in her bed in the ward Bertha lay shivering and huddling</p>
<p>like the dumb thing that had been hurt. Then they washed a little</p>
<p>spot on her arm with cotton and jabbed a needle in. There was no</p>
<p>pain but after a time she lay back....</p>
<p>Wonder of Bertha. The hems of her skirts were sour with bilge water</p>
<p>and she had been forced to hold her right wrist with her left fingers</p>
<p>in order to sprawl her name half legibly on the dotted line ... but</p>
<p>The Cathedral Under the Sea was of her and yet not hers. And</p>
<p>now--her son, choir-faced, with the wisps of old music that were so</p>
<p>lovely to her, tranced in his eyes--was of her and yet not hers--of</p>
<p>her and yet not hers--.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Days with the old flow to them.</p>
<p>Odds and ends of jobs. For months she resumed the night work in the</p>
<p>Equitable Building, but the crones were all sly-eyed when she</p>
<p>returned and her finger tips began to split painfully. Besides, the</p>
<p>days at Annie's were becoming not only intolerable but impossible for</p>
<p>sleep, with Jocko chittering and skithering from keg to chair and</p>
<p>Annie in a hunch beside the table and mumbling constantly into her</p>
<p>cup.</p>
<p>When she had saved ten dollars she started in at the agencies again.</p>
<p>The rows of mornings in the rows of chairs. At Raussman's</p>
<p>Intelligence Office on Fourth Avenue, they began to favor Bertha,</p>
<p>handing her out addresses and placing her in a conspicuous chair near</p>
<p>the railing. She changed places so frequently and the more she</p>
<p>shifted about, of course, the more she yielded in commissions. On</p>
<p>again. Off again.</p>
<p>At kitchen work in a Broadway lunch room, they put her at washing</p>
<p>dishes, but the first hour she was dismissed by the proprietor who</p>
<p>followed her to the door with his toes fairly lapping her heels.</p>
<p>"Washin' the dishes in two waters. You're a fine square-head, you</p>
<p>are. Who do you think I'm in business for? The public's health or</p>
<p>mine--you get the hell out of here--"</p>
<p>It was all a part of the day. Her broad back without a quiver to it.</p>
<p>Like Annie's words, they jounced off and fell at her feet like dead</p>
<p>leaves, through which she walked, as if in the forests of her inner</p>
<p>tranquillity.</p>
<p>At another of these eating places the kitchens were small and</p>
<p>Bertha's bulk so dominant that she created a sort of pixie</p>
<p>psychology. Waitresses, by contrast made gay and delightfully aware</p>
<p>of their slim flanks, slid under her arms, giggling. One little one</p>
<p>stood behind Bertha and called, "Find me." She was like some huge</p>
<p>impervious Golem, all the pixies running up her knees and arms to</p>
<p>play and pinch and poke in her eyeballs.</p>
<p>After a week she left.</p>
<p>Then she began to hold out for domestic service, sitting stiffly</p>
<p>averted against demands for restaurant help or char work.</p>
<p>The elder daughter in a private family of six took her home one day</p>
<p>in an automobile, to a rococo brownstone front in West Fifty-third</p>
<p>Street. There was brook trout _au meunière_ for the family luncheon</p>
<p>that noon, but the canned salmon, which she had been obliged to</p>
<p>pinken up with soda for the servants' meal, poisoned the crew of</p>
<p>them, and Bertha, wretched from her own illness, was the first to</p>
<p>pack up her bag and depart.</p>
<p>In a cream-colored renaissance home of stone lace and gargoyles in</p>
<p>East Sixty-first Street the bed she was forced to share with the</p>
<p>waitress was a three-quarter one and the waitress herself a large</p>
<p>south of Ireland girl, with a scrofula running up her leg that was</p>
<p>frightening.</p>
<p>Secret places of the household, these, that were never aired along</p>
<p>with servants' bedding or the servant problem.</p>
<p>Two old gentlewomen with frail hands and cameo brooches and a house</p>
<p>in Nineteenth Street that breathed dampness like a cave, asked all</p>
<p>their questions simultaneously and engaged her in a breathless duet.</p>
<p>It had been a large household once and there were rooms with</p>
<p>workbaskets left open with the bit of colored embroidery half out of</p>
<p>it, just as a beloved daughter had left it when her last illness</p>
<p>tapped her on the shoulder; a half-written letter on a desk that a</p>
<p>brother's death had interrupted. A home full of the reminders of the</p>
<p>casualness of life. It was more like a half-way house. Some one had</p>
<p>paused there to do a bit of colored embroidery. A child dancing</p>
<p>through the interval between its birth in the south chamber and its</p>
<p>death there, had left a muslin doll on the floor with its arm stuck</p>
<p>grotesquely up. It was like walking between the slabs of Trinity.</p>
<p>Grotesque stick-ups where there had been a life.</p>
<p>One night up in her room next to where the winter potatoes were</p>
<p>stored, a thought smote Bertha that sent her bounding up from her cot</p>
<p>and barefoot over the splintery floor to the window. Sure enough,</p>
<p>there through the leaded pane, the spire to the Farley house in</p>
<p>Gramercy Park was plainly visible. Pointing! There was no window</p>
<p>shade, so she pinned her flannel petticoat across the glass. But all</p>
<p>night through the flannel and her closed lids, the spire kept</p>
<p>pointing. Pointing.</p>
<p>At dawn she laid the fires for the old ladies and left.</p>
<p>Raussman's again. Two weeks of sitting there through the sullen</p>
<p>mornings of inspection. There were only coins left in her petticoat</p>
<p>pocket, that rattled softly when she moved. Bertha hated hunger.</p>
<p>She could sleep on the carpet sofa at Annie's and poke through drain</p>
<p>pipes without much nausea, but hunger slashed through her bulk like</p>
<p>the blades of a great machine. Foregoing the morning cup of</p>
<p>five-cent coffee at Annie's was an economy, but it made the day wavy.</p>
<p>It rose up on all sides of her and sometimes towards noon she dozed</p>
<p>with its motion and old man Raussman had to yank at her cape.</p>
<p>"Wake up. We ain't got no calls for sleeping beauties."</p>
<p>But one day he handed out a Riverside Drive address to her on a dirty</p>
<p>slip of paper. "Musliner. Two in family. Cook."</p>
<p>Mr. Musliner, a two-weeks-old bridegroom, interviewed her in the</p>
<p>kitchen and engaged her without parley.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was pleasant at the Musliners. A bride had furnished it. Creamy</p>
<p>light of new woodwork and pale paneled walls. An oval drawing-room</p>
<p>in the fragile mood of Fragonard. Dining room in marquetry and the</p>
<p>panel above the mantelpiece another bow to Fragonard. A pair of</p>
<p>solid gold Adam urns. Grapes in December. Crystal chandeliers</p>
<p>tittering with light.</p>
<p>An entire corridor of little nonsense bedrooms in a hush of rose</p>
<p>taffetas and Canet beds _bouffant_ with _point d'esprit_. Mrs.</p>
<p>Musliner's was a shell that curved her to it as if she were a pearl.</p>
<p>She awoke that way, a lovely pink one in its heart, with the laces</p>
<p>creaming about her. Mr. Musliner's, next to, but not adjoining hers,</p>
<p>was in the same mood _mousse_, except with certain sterner</p>
<p>concessions. No frothings. His bed cover was a pale gold brocade</p>
<p>with a large diamond-shaped monogram in the center. Chiffonier</p>
<p>mirror adjusted to his shaving line. An old-fashioned leather collar</p>
<p>box, which sometimes crept out of a top drawer of certain of his</p>
<p>cherished bachelor possessions, along with a smelly old pipe that</p>
<p>violated the pale brocade scarf.</p>
<p>Mrs. Musliner would tuck them out of sight, her lips shuddering</p>
<p>slightly as if her teeth were on edge. They could lift back like</p>
<p>that frequently on those very rare occasions when she permitted</p>
<p>herself to be alone. They were very, very rare. Always guests.</p>
<p>Luncheon. Tea. Dinner guests in candle-and-flower-lit circle around</p>
<p>lace over pink. Week-end guests, who nested in the little frilled</p>
<p>rooms off the corridors and, night after night, some girl friend or</p>
<p>other to share the lovely lace mist of Mrs. Musliner's bed.</p>
<p>Even Bertha's room, directly off the kitchen and facing a court</p>
<p>darkly, could look sunny with the strip of new chintz on her</p>
<p>washstand and a blue cotton bed cover with fringe. The housemaid and</p>
<p>the waitress, sisters, had their room at the top of the apartment</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>It was warm in Bertha's room and she liked to sit in it evenings,</p>
<p>barefoot and wide-kneed in the dark, with the door leading to the</p>
<p>kitchen left open, its fine white porcelain refrigerator like a dim</p>
<p>smile across the silence.</p>
<p>But a dim unvibrant sort of silence now, as if she were seated in the</p>
<p>vacuum of a closed bell. All the little jeweled sands had run away.</p>
<p>Sometimes she looked at them in the little islands of words that were</p>
<p>margined so wide; fingering the leaves of her hurt bird of a book,</p>
<p>which she kept wrapped away in the green chiffon cloak.</p>
<p>And the wisps of old sound. She had seen them, too, but not in the</p>
<p>book. Tranced in her baby's eyes like the candy stripe down the</p>
<p>center of the crystal.</p>
<p>To the pain of that empty cove of her arm where the small head had</p>
<p>lain she had done horrid, unmentionable things. Sunk her teeth into</p>
<p>the yearning flesh of it, leaving an inflamed crescent the shape of</p>
<p>her bite. Rubbed one bare foot up and down against the other leg</p>
<p>until the skin came off like erased blotting paper. Prayed to an</p>
<p>inchoate God which she scarcely knew, except as a curse word upon</p>
<p>Annie's lips. A hurt, beautiful word that could smoke in her heart.</p>
<p>But now the silences had come back. Not the old singing ones that</p>
<p>had been vibrant as a black cat's arched flank. The merer silence of</p>
<p>the inside of a bell.</p>
<p>And in this silence she was like a wound healing, the little line of</p>
<p>the scar shirring up.</p>
<p>The Musliners were kind.</p>
<p>He did the ordering and was more frequently in the kitchen than she,</p>
<p>who danced in only upon the gay occasion of candy pullings and every</p>
<p>so often for the excited unwrapping of belated and excelsior-bound</p>
<p>wedding gifts.</p>
<p>Shortly after he left in the morning, deliveries began. Great T-bone</p>
<p>beefsteaks. Braces of wild fowl packed in hampers. Grapes in</p>
<p>December wadded in cotton. Foreign-looking tins of caviar. Marron</p>
<p>glace. Chinese ginger. And especially for Mrs. Musliner, who loved</p>
<p>littlenesses, plover eggs and palm-sized squabs with bones like</p>
<p>toothpicks.</p>
<p>Once, that first winter of their marriage he brought her home, all</p>
<p>cotton-wrapped in an enormous carton, an entire miniature farmyard</p>
<p>made out of marzipan for the centerpiece that night at her birthday</p>
<p>dinner.</p>
<p>She was like a child and bit off the head of a lamb with a squeak of</p>
<p>delight. He tried to kiss her there at the unwrapping of it, because</p>
<p>in her pink pearl kind of loveliness she was a phantom of delight to</p>
<p>him. But she had a way of evading his wetted lips and their</p>
<p>background of brown face, with a steely strength that the moment</p>
<p>could seem to lend her.</p>
<p>Once when there had been only one week-end house guest and he had</p>
<p>gone to his room, Bertha had seen Musliner softly knocking at his</p>
<p>wife's door. Almost scratching like a dog.</p>
<p>"Erna." he whispered in the caressing way his brown lips had of</p>
<p>saying her name, "Erna." As if the word were a puff of down.</p>
<p>"Dearest. Please?" It was very quiet in the hall and her closed door</p>
<p>like a tongue out at him.</p>
<p>Something like an ache for Musliner smote Bertha. He was so kind.</p>
<p>Often in the fruit hampers was a bag of sweets tucked away for the</p>
<p>servants and on Bertha's every other Thursday out, a dollar bill was</p>
<p>left lying for her on the kitchen table. He was sensitive, too, in a</p>
<p>way that hurt Bertha dimly. Once when she had inadvertently stumbled</p>
<p>upon him, seated alone in the dining room with his head in his hands,</p>
<p>he had jumped up redly, giving her a random order with a brusqueness</p>
<p>not his....</p>
<p>He would have jumped redly, too, had he seen Bertha seeing him as he</p>
<p>knocked and tried the door softly.</p>
<p>"Erna--dear. You asleep? It's Ben. Please. Dear? I want to come</p>
<p>in."</p>
<p>Finally he went back to his room, closing the door.</p>
<p>Bertha somehow, knew.</p>
<p>Doors. The long corridors of her silence were all nicked up with the</p>
<p>sounds of them, closing.</p>
<p>One day, when May like a shy pink parasol was beginning to open wide</p>
<p>and wider over the city, a lovely thing happened to Bertha.</p>
<p>The Musliners gave a picnic. Thirty guests climbed gleefully into a</p>
<p>moving van especially upholstered in gay cretonnes for the occasion</p>
<p>and rode fifteen miles up the Hudson to a grove, recently acquired by</p>
<p>Mr. Musliner as an anniversary gift to his wife.</p>
<p>There were hampers of food and freezers of cream and cases of drinks</p>
<p>and dozens of lemons and all the flimsy paper napkin and wooden plate</p>
<p>paraphernalia dear to picnickers. Hundreds of sandwiches. Pails of</p>
<p>salad. Cakes of every turn known to Bertha's hand. For two days</p>
<p>Bertha and Julie the waitress and Lulu the housemaid buttered and</p>
<p>sliced and wrapped in oiled paper and packed.</p>
<p>A set of white enameled picnic dishes arrived which Mrs. Musliner</p>
<p>rejected as "spoiling the fun." Apples were dipped into syrup and</p>
<p>impaled upon sticks. Boxes of marshmallows for toasting. Potatoes</p>
<p>for roasting. Hammocks were packed into the van and an old</p>
<p>upholstered couch upon which Mrs. Musliner reclined, once they had</p>
<p>reached the open road, her guests in mock homage about her.</p>
<p>Bertha and Julie rode in front with the driver. How they chattered!</p>
<p>Julie was a dark, nervous girl. Rather pretty in her waitress</p>
<p>uniform, but sagged and run-down-looking in street clothes. She had</p>
<p>been married once and upon the slightest provocation would display a</p>
<p>scar across her neck to indicate where a jealous husband had</p>
<p>attempted to cut her throat. When the driver saw it he tried to kiss</p>
<p>her there and she lurched against Bertha and Bertha lurched against</p>
<p>the side of the van and the open road rang with laughter. Julie's.</p>
<p>The driver's. And the rising merriment of the group behind.</p>
<p>Bertha's laughter, too.</p>
<p>The day was so soft. Warmth ran up her legs. The driver reached</p>
<p>around Julie's shoulder to pinch her and she reached across Julie's</p>
<p>lap to slap him--plump in the stomach, so that he simulated pain,</p>
<p>while really he was doubled up with guffawing.</p>
<p>From inside the van someone spied an organ grinder toiling up the</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>"An organ grinder! Come on in. Hey--you--stop. Come on in. Mucha</p>
<p>mon! Comma to picnic. Mucha mon. See. Play for the queen on the</p>
<p>dais. Come up--in."</p>
<p>And so the lifted, bewildered Italian dragged merrily into the van</p>
<p>and the horse flecked onward with a whip that flashed into an S.</p>
<p>The river ran ahead to show them the road. Bertha had never seen a</p>
<p>river. This one was quick and gay and on its way somewhere. Not</p>
<p>full of lips like the harbor.</p>
<p>On its way to the grove. On its way to the grove.</p>
<p>"Looka," cried Julie, "all them rusty tin cans down by the water.</p>
<p>Some tin can sports musta passed this way."</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh. Oh." Julie holding both her sides with laughter and the</p>
<p>driver letting his lines slide to lean over and hold them for her,</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>"Look at that Bo over there in the field," he cried, cracking the S</p>
<p>with his whip, "that ain't a nose on him--somebody fired a ripe</p>
<p>tomater and it stuck."</p>
<p>"Oh la, la! Ripe tomater. Ain't he bloody? A ripe tomater. Go</p>
<p>tell that to your rich uncle if his laughs don't come easy."</p>
<p>"Well, Square-head, it's your looka now. Looka now. Looka there.</p>
<p>Looka quick, and tell us what you see--"</p>
<p>"He says, 'Looka quick, Bertha.' Come outta your trance and look!</p>
<p>Whadda you see? Look about you. Looka here. Looka there."</p>
<p>"Looka, looka," cried Bertha half daft with the lush smell of grass</p>
<p>and of warmth, "looka those clouds--white--white clouds--little</p>
<p>children up there--see--falling outta bed--"</p>
<p>"Oh Lord, that's a good one! Giddy ap, you gol-darn plugs</p>
<p>you--little children falling outta bed.</p>
<p>Oh lud, it's great to be crazy,</p>
<p>It's great to be crazy,</p>
<p>Oh lud, it's great, oh it's great to be nuts.</p>
<p>And then Julie taking up the refrain.</p>
<p>"Oh lud, it's great, oh it's great, to be nuts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Grove ran out in a point to the river and would not let it pass,</p>
<p>so the water went around it with a soft hiss. One tree grew almost</p>
<p>horizontal and laughed down at it.</p>
<p>Little Mrs. Musliner, with her blouse open at the throat and</p>
<p>whortleberry leaves in her hair, jumped astride it and beat it as if</p>
<p>it had been a horse.</p>
<p>"Giddy-app--my trusty steed--swim me across the Hellespont!"</p>
<p>Bertha, tilting the salt water out of the ice cream freezer, stood</p>
<p>almost waiting for the plunge and the sound of foam and the arrowhead</p>
<p>line of the water parting before the tree stump whose leaves were a</p>
<p>flowing mane.</p>
<p>A Young Fellow who dined frequently at the house snatched up a fruit</p>
<p>knife from one of the hampers, clamped the blade between his teeth,</p>
<p>and flew on the tree trunk behind her, balancing her against the</p>
<p>shock with his hands on her light young hips, and the guests stood</p>
<p>back and cheered.</p>
<p>"If I was little Musliner, I'd wipe up the floor with that young</p>
<p>customer," said Julie, who was squeezing lemons.</p>
<p>"What?" said Bertha.</p>
<p>"Aw--you--hunky--you don't know you're on earth unless somebody</p>
<p>stages an earthquake under you."</p>
<p>Suddenly Musliner came running down the turf, straddling the tree</p>
<p>trunk, too, his little legs waving and too short even to dangle</p>
<p>loosely.</p>
<p>"We're off," he shouted and dug with his knees into the spongy bark.</p>
<p>"Three's a crowd," sang somebody. "Who has the grace to stay home</p>
<p>from the Hellespont?"</p>
<p>"Why I have," cried the Young Fellow, bounding off, and the red</p>
<p>scorching through his fine tan.</p>
<p>"Now," cried Mr. Musliner, wriggling forward with his short fat</p>
<p>knees, his hands coming down on the curve of his wife's slim young</p>
<p>hips--"Now--we're off--alone!"</p>
<p>But suddenly Mrs. Musliner was tired. She climbed down jerking back</p>
<p>from his touch. The wind and the May had gone out of her face.</p>
<p>"Come on," she said, "let us eat."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The meal was already spread on long wooden planks set up on wooden</p>
<p>braces, but someone found a natural table of dog violets set out</p>
<p>beside a little orchestra of waterfall and with great ado and much</p>
<p>merriment the feast was moved up the hillside.</p>
<p>Under her breath Julie bitterly demurred. The climb was rocky and</p>
<p>the running back and forth, from the hampers in the van to the remote</p>
<p>spot on the knoll, twisted her ankles and strained her back and once,</p>
<p>scaling the top, she fell and barked her shin and passed sandwiches</p>
<p>over gay shoulders with her eyelids stung with the heat of the</p>
<p>held-back tears.</p>
<p>But Bertha! With one heft of her arm she carried a case of wine,</p>
<p>running with it lightly over the knoll. The dance up and the dance</p>
<p>down. Ice cream freezers to be rolled up hill. She shoved aside the</p>
<p>assistance of the driver and spun them in an ecstasy along the dark,</p>
<p>damp flesh of earth. Rocks bit in through her shoes and she wanted</p>
<p>to kick them off, so that her freed toes might bite them back.</p>
<p>Rivers of strength seemed pressing at the dam of her body. She</p>
<p>wanted the knoll to be a mountain that she might stagger, slip, and</p>
<p>sweat up its flank, and the hampers to be kegs with the weight to</p>
<p>bend her double.</p>
<p>The old Slav song of the women far behind her, who had worn the runic</p>
<p>brooch, was so close to her consciousness that she wanted to sing it</p>
<p>as she mounted the hill. The muted old concertina in her carpetbag,</p>
<p>from dear knows what ancestral squatter in a peasant hut---she could</p>
<p>have played it then; squeezed some of the locked-up ecstasies through</p>
<p>it. She wanted to run. Feet were not mute--they tasted the sap of</p>
<p>earth and bounded back vibrant with it as if they had drunk wine.</p>
<p>The hillside. It cut her. It skinned her shoes and on the inside</p>
<p>her toes curled, pushed against her stockings, and wanted out.</p>
<p>The wine ran in little pools. The Young Fellow, with his fingers for</p>
<p>Pan's pipes, did an oafish dance around the table that was spread</p>
<p>with wood violets. Someone tossed a great platter of the sandwiches</p>
<p>high up and let them rain down again, splattering and scattering.</p>
<p>Mrs. Musliner sucked at a candied apple and shot out her little red</p>
<p>bib of a tongue at everybody, but longest and reddest to the Young</p>
<p>Fellow, who touched the top of it with his forefinger and then</p>
<p>pressed that forefinger behind his ear.</p>
<p>The sun, hot and high and prodigal, made great stains of light and</p>
<p>shade. After a while groups and pairs began to shy off. One dark</p>
<p>youth in eyeglasses stretched himself solemnly down the length of the</p>
<p>table of dog violets, an empty wine bottle very tight in his clutch,</p>
<p>and almost immediately fell asleep. Mrs. Musliner, side-stepping him</p>
<p>gingerly, stuck a lilac spray upright between his teeth, so that it</p>
<p>waved there to the tipsy wind of his breath. Then she and the Young</p>
<p>Fellow squealing delight at this danced off down a footpath that</p>
<p>turned suddenly and wiggled teasingly through some underbrush.</p>
<p>Even Julie and the driver had gone off and the organ-grinder lay</p>
<p>asleep in a tree hollow with his body all up in a coil.</p>
<p>It was pleasant tiptoeing over the violets and wadding all the paper</p>
<p>napkins up in a ball, and poking them out of sight in a hamper and</p>
<p>stacking the wooden plates and scattering the crumbs and running up</p>
<p>and down the knoll and clearing the forest back into its woodland</p>
<p>quiet, so that the tinkle of the waterfall came through again and,</p>
<p>except for those caught under the sleeping figure with the lilac</p>
<p>spray waving in his breath, all the little violets lifted themselves</p>
<p>up again as if after a storm.</p>
<p>Once, rolling an empty freezer down a steeper side of the knoll, she</p>
<p>came upon Musliner, seated at the head of the trail that wiggled so</p>
<p>naughtily off through some underbrush, and chewing a blade of grass.</p>
<p>"Well, Bertha, we seem to be the sole survivers of the party."</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Musliner, it's grand."</p>
<p>"Grand." A word as lonesome as a mountain and she wanted to tell him</p>
<p>warmly about the lovely, green-lace grove of his and of the Slav song</p>
<p>that ran along her throat wanting out, just as her feet running over</p>
<p>the warm earth in their bluchers wanted out. "Grand." She could</p>
<p>have bitten her tongue for some of its blood to flow into and warm</p>
<p>what she wanted to say, but all that she had was "grand" and so she</p>
<p>stood saying it and smiling at him with the lips which she hated</p>
<p>because they were mutes.</p>
<p>"You're a good girl, Bertha," he said, looking at her with eyes that</p>
<p>were hurt as if they had spikes through them, "you don't run off and</p>
<p>shirk the job like Julie. Here."</p>
<p>He handed her a silver dollar. She took it and should have gone on</p>
<p>trundling her ice cream freezer down the hillside toward the van, but</p>
<p>somehow she didn't. She stood there, looking and wetting at her lips.</p>
<p>"Well?" he said. He was half seated on a tree stump, one leg</p>
<p>dangling, and chewing and chewing the blade of grass along his front</p>
<p>teeth.</p>
<p>Her gaze kept darting from him to down the little snake of trail and</p>
<p>her throat kept tightening. She knew. He had worked very hard over</p>
<p>this day. Her day. It lay now in a ruin around him, as he sat there</p>
<p>chewing the grass blade his brown lips twisted as if it were bitter.</p>
<p>In the tree hollow the organ grinder slept in his tight little coil.</p>
<p>Bertha trundling the ice cream freezer down the hill. Otherwise no</p>
<p>one left back. Not even Julie and the driver. Little bells of</p>
<p>laughter through the trees. Bertha somehow didn't matter. For the</p>
<p>life of him he could not keep his eyes, as if they were wounded in</p>
<p>his head, from rolling a little toward that trail.</p>
<p>"I'll bring you a candied apple," she said.</p>
<p>She wanted him to be surly. It would have been easier then, for her</p>
<p>not to be sorry, but he smiled and nodded no, and all she could think</p>
<p>of to say through the ache in her throat was:</p>
<p>"There is an ice cream rooster left over and some Burgundy. You</p>
<p>would like a nice cool glass of Burgundy?"</p>
<p>"No, Bertha," he said, "thank you, now you run along and clear up and</p>
<p>don't you bother about me." But his eyes were traveling down the</p>
<p>trail with hers, and finally he rose and came over to her, looking up</p>
<p>at her from his squatness and with the brownish whites to his eyes</p>
<p>very prominent.</p>
<p>"She's very young, Bertha," he said. "We must help her."</p>
<p>"I--want to--"</p>
<p>"Help her, Bertha. Never let her do anything that will make her</p>
<p>unhappy. She is too young to see clearly ahead--you are a</p>
<p>home-body--watch over her, Bertha--mother her."</p>
<p>Mother, That was a word that could twist her and make her want to</p>
<p>bite at the cove of her arm, and yet, standing there on the hillside,</p>
<p>hurting with this man's pain, it was as if something within her were</p>
<p>spreading to cover a huddler. Actually, Bertha was two months</p>
<p>younger than Mrs. Musliner, but so strangely older in the locked-up</p>
<p>lore of the dim procession that peopled her silences!</p>
<p>Back in that procession, a young fledgling who walked in beauty and</p>
<p>whose Sonatas had not yet been born, but whose melodies were to wind</p>
<p>down through the centuries, had pursued a girl with flax-colored</p>
<p>braids like Bertha's, across a plushy field in south of Hungary,</p>
<p>capturing her finally and kissing her. At first she beat him off and</p>
<p>then, because his lips were rich and his young head defiant, like a</p>
<p>child's, it was she who held him. Broodily and close to her heart in</p>
<p>the harvest moonlight ... at dawn he was still singing softly to a</p>
<p>great-great-grandmother of Bertha, troubled wisps of melodies that</p>
<p>were not quite born to him yet--precious, groping old songs that were</p>
<p>locked now in the heart of Bertha. Old Bertha, who was two months</p>
<p>younger than Mrs. Musliner.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sunlight bowed back out of the grove and the couples and groups</p>
<p>came back tiredly and happily and hungrily out of the dusk. The</p>
<p>driver built a bonfire and the Young Fellow unpacked the marshmallows</p>
<p>and Bertha, with the water singing over her hands, washed the</p>
<p>potatoes for roasting at the spring, and a full moon as dainty as an</p>
<p>apricot came up between two trees.</p>
<p>Firelight on faces. Eager mouths with the teeth showing, hovering</p>
<p>over just the right brownness of marshmallow. Low laughter. The</p>
<p>grove crowding up around the circle of light. Mrs. Musliner, with</p>
<p>her face in her palms and the reflected firelight leaping and falling</p>
<p>in her eyes which had crybaby rims around them. The smell of</p>
<p>darkness and the bleed of sap. Leaves, curling and burning to death</p>
<p>with gestures of human pain. Over by the spring it was so dark that</p>
<p>it seemed to Bertha that the evening was some great black cow</p>
<p>standing there beside her panting softly, so that she could feel its</p>
<p>sides breathe. Sweet-smelling darkness with a give to it like a</p>
<p>cow's flank. The earth beside the spring was all wet with clear</p>
<p>water and leaning over to rinse potatoes, she could feel the little</p>
<p>sucks, greedily at her feet.</p>
<p>Warm, pulling, sucking earth that had teased her all day and over</p>
<p>which her feet wanted to leap, free!</p>
<p>And then Bertha sat down, slyly, on a moss-tinged jut of rock, and</p>
<p>picked up her skirts, and down came her great balbriggan stockings,</p>
<p>wide-ribbed and the color of clay, and out sprang her legs. White</p>
<p>urns in the gloom. The rip open of buttons. Little yawns of her</p>
<p>empty shoes standing there on a dirt ledge. Squnch, into the slow</p>
<p>pour of the good black mud that closed up around her ankles like a</p>
<p>strong and hungry mouth.</p>
<p>Squnch. Squnch. Squirm of the pouring soil up between her churning,</p>
<p>spatulate toes. She could feel it with the very pit of her. Warm.</p>
<p>Black. Close. Her mysterious friend, the soil, whispering to her</p>
<p>with those tight eager lips--it was difficult not to throw out her</p>
<p>arms and shout--tear open her bulk of blouse where it cluttered her</p>
<p>breast and shout--the curling, winding, whispering, kissing soil</p>
<p>hugging her with its eager lips--she wanted to run--to run back</p>
<p>barefoot along the plushy fields.</p>
<p>The organ grinder, dazed with good food and drink, began suddenly to</p>
<p>grind out, in rapid spill from his hurdy gurdy, a folk song out of</p>
<p>Ukrainia.</p>
<p>High cheek bones and velvet bodices that laced up in front. Red</p>
<p>cotton skirts that twirled. Men in high boots and tight red sashes</p>
<p>and fine mustachios that scratched! Sweat in hovels. Long low</p>
<p>rafters, candlelight-scarred. Quivering hips. Waving mugs. Low of</p>
<p>bulls and slow, hot smell of steaming dung heaps. Sweat and love and</p>
<p>courage of solitary childbirth on wide moors. Strength of splayed</p>
<p>Slav lips! Yeow, the ring of rafters! Yeow, the splayed Slav lips!</p>
<p>Bertha with her arms outspread and a yeow that landed her squat on</p>
<p>her heels out on a spot of turf that was stained with the firelight!</p>
<p>"Hurra! Look! Who is this? The cook! That's the girl. Give us a</p>
<p>dance. Native heath, by Jove. Look at your Swede, Muzz, spinning a</p>
<p>goulash fandangle. Bravo, go to it--Yuiop-- I say!"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Spinning tarantellas with broad white toe for pivot. Swaying hip</p>
<p>rhythm, eyes slits, like wise smiling old buttonholes. Hands broad</p>
<p>on haunches and little bulge of bacchanalian belly--Yeow--squat heels</p>
<p>deep in turf, arms flung wade and half wrenched from sockets! Leg</p>
<p>out from under. Yeow--up again on toe pivot--spin--spin--laughter</p>
<p>over wild moors--sweat in hovels--hot male hands on square-hipped</p>
<p>girls--scratch of mustachios against laughing, square-teethed</p>
<p>women--crones with the soil ground into their wrinkles. Sing,</p>
<p>peasant, sing, and swing the grinning scythe! Sing of the strong</p>
<p>fertilizing soil and the dung heaps that steam and the crones that</p>
<p>are wise with old lore and the women who love, and who bear, and who</p>
<p>weep, and the wide-legged men with the necks like tree boles.</p>
<p>Sing--Yeow--of meat and of soil and of strength and of love--sing</p>
<p>Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!</p>
<p>The hurdy-gurdy suddenly silent--Bertha with her arms flung wide and</p>
<p>half wrenched from their sockets. Toes in the soil. Hair down. Her</p>
<p>bosom where the waist had fallen open gleaming and high.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Going home through the languid night it was Bertha who sat next to</p>
<p>the driver, his knee slyly digging up against hers which she flung</p>
<p>angrily back.</p>
<p>"Big girl. Good girl." He kept saying over and over again under his</p>
<p>breath without moving his lips.</p>
<p>She felt the tail of his glance slide over her bosom where the waist</p>
<p>had fallen open and she clutched it closed and kept edging toward</p>
<p>Julie, who was sullen.</p>
<p>"Before I'd dance for pennies, like a dago's monkey. What's the</p>
<p>idea, giving a free show without an invite? I know my place, I do.</p>
<p>They'd have showed you yours, if they wasn't all boozy as boiled</p>
<p>owls. Listen to them now. I'm a self-respecting girl. I know my</p>
<p>place. I don't dance for pennies. That dance was a give-away. You</p>
<p>musta been born in a cow house where they dance all night and then</p>
<p>grab up their pails and start to milking. That's old country</p>
<p>dancing. I'm American. I know my place."</p>
<p>"What did I--do--Julie?"</p>
<p>"What did you do? Say, was it as bad as that? You musta had some</p>
<p>inside information on the Burgundy. Made a holy show of yourself,</p>
<p>that's what you did."</p>
<p>All the way home, edging away from the driver's horrid knee, the</p>
<p>question kept spinning inside her brain, "What did I do? What?</p>
<p>What?"</p>
<p>She felt so empty. As if all the strength had run out through her</p>
<p>fingers and toes. A flask that had been drained of wine, that for</p>
<p>years and years had been beating against its sides.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One evening in a winter that roared with blizzard, and snowstorms</p>
<p>like plunging white buffaloes leaped before city traffic, there were</p>
<p>dinner covers for eight at the Musliners, but no guests. Automobile</p>
<p>wheels ground futilely in the hub-high ruts. Surface cars, shaggy</p>
<p>with storm, stalled in their tracks. The streets slept standing,</p>
<p>like horses.</p>
<p>In spite of Bertha skimming each new grease film off of the foods,</p>
<p>dinner began to cloy, the entrée of creamed mushrooms darkening, the</p>
<p>patty cases sagging as they waited.</p>
<p>With fever spots in her cheeks, Mrs. Musliner, in a bower of the</p>
<p>tulle that her dress formed around her, kept rattling at the</p>
<p>telephone, her urgent forefinger frantically up and down at it, but</p>
<p>the wires were under the storm and only snow-hush came through.</p>
<p>"Central--you must answer--it's urgent--you must--hello--"</p>
<p>In his dinner clothes and very brown above the white of his shirt</p>
<p>front, Mr. Musliner chided her in a little good-humored way he had.</p>
<p>"Well, little Snow White, it looks for once as if you must have</p>
<p>dinner all alone with your old hubby."</p>
<p>Her smile up at him could be like a crucifixion--as if a tourniquet</p>
<p>twisting in the very ganglia of her were forcing her lips to part.</p>
<p>"Central," she implored, working the hook up and down, "please--won't</p>
<p>you answer?"</p>
<p>Through the little glass pane in the pantry door, Bertha could see</p>
<p>him, bumbling about the rose tulle of her in the slow hitting fashion</p>
<p>of a brown bee, his hand, wanting to touch her but constantly</p>
<p>withdrawing, did pause at her throat where it flowed palely down into</p>
<p>her bodice. It stiffened at his approach and a rib of vein came out.</p>
<p>Julie, peeping too, sniggered. He had a curiously sensitive blush.</p>
<p>It came up, redly, as if he had heard.</p>
<p>"Central--can't you hear--you must answer."</p>
<p>He walked over to the buffet and shot out a swallow of seltzer.</p>
<p>"Afraid it looks like a quiet evening--alone, Little One," he said,</p>
<p>with his words etched on his laugh like a design against thin glass.</p>
<p>She hung up the receiver, with the one vein still out on her pretty</p>
<p>throat, and drew up her chair beside the lace, the flower- and the</p>
<p>candle-spread table.</p>
<p>"Of course, Ben, it's just disappointing, that's all. Horrid old</p>
<p>storm." She made a little _moue_ and he looked at her adoring it,</p>
<p>and then started for the vacant place beside her.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said and leaped backward--"I--they may come yet."</p>
<p>"How stupid--of course--they may--come yet," he said and took his</p>
<p>accustomed place, remotely opposite, but his eyes, with their</p>
<p>liver-spotted whites, eager for her through the little jungle of fern</p>
<p>and pink roses of the center piece.</p>
<p>In the kitchen Bertha began to ladle out the bouillon. It made a</p>
<p>clear little pouring noise. Like a thin cry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A square of light from a window across the areaway could work its way</p>
<p>into Bertha's room in a luminous plaster. Long after the electric</p>
<p>bulb, dangling by a wire over her cot, was snapped out she liked to</p>
<p>lie regarding the reflected glow.</p>
<p>A patch of warmth against solitude. A cave with a lit mouth. It was</p>
<p>pleasant to walk through it and down into the aisles of doze....</p>
<p>That night, the glow sprang sharply across the snow-packed areaway</p>
<p>and long after she had crawled into her cot, she lay at this</p>
<p>fantastic entrance into her sleep, dallying.</p>
<p>Little wisps of smoke rose off the embers of the day. Half</p>
<p>consciousnesses. Six of the eight medallions of the salmon _mousse_</p>
<p>were left over. That ridge of fear in a vein out across Mrs.</p>
<p>Musliner's throat. The Farleys would have relished the salmon</p>
<p>_mousse_ creamed the next day. Not the Musliners. Sufficient unto</p>
<p>the day the salmon thereof. The grapes he had brought her were</p>
<p>wadded in cotton and in the upper section of the refrigerator. Would</p>
<p>the salmon _mousse_ taint them of fishiness? Snow. A wide, wide</p>
<p>wilderness of it with humpbacks walking hidden under it and pushing</p>
<p>it up into mountains. Drip. Hollow, pleasant rhythm, through the</p>
<p>doze that made it difficult to awaken. Drip. Drip. Drip. That</p>
<p>must be the ice pan flooding. It was so hard to awaken. Drip.</p>
<p>Drip. Drip. Doors. The brown door that was Musliner and it led</p>
<p>inward to a dwelling place of light. Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>And then in a crash through the light fabric of this doze, a pink</p>
<p>little cyclone.</p>
<p>It was hard for Bertha to cross the hair line from her dim sleep to</p>
<p>her dim reality.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" she cried. "What?" And sat up in the gilt darkness,</p>
<p>two enormous braids of her tan hair hitting against the wall like</p>
<p>rope.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Musliner, in a nightgown made pinker by the flicker of</p>
<p>her body through it, shuddering there on the floor behind the refuge</p>
<p>of the door she had slammed and locked.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Musliner!"</p>
<p>"Bertha, hide me. Keep me here with you. Alone. Bertha, let me</p>
<p>stay here with you."</p>
<p>She was trembling so that her nightgown went rippling along her limbs</p>
<p>and her teeth and her lips were fanned dry with moans. And Bertha,</p>
<p>Norse in her hulk, and in the great flannel undersuit and petticoat,</p>
<p>stooping over the torn little huddle there on the floor.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Musliner--little baby--what is it?'</p>
<p>"Keep me, Bertha. Hold me tight. You will keep me, won't you,</p>
<p>Bertha?"</p>
<p>"Baby. Little mine. You'll catch cold. You have bad dreams. This</p>
<p>is no place for you."</p>
<p>"Let me stay. You're so quiet, Bertha. Let me stay here with you.</p>
<p>It calms me. What are you hearing all the time while you work? What</p>
<p>do you know? Bertha, tell me--what makes you so still--what do you</p>
<p>know that I don't know--help me to know it too--help me be quiet like</p>
<p>you--that dance--I remember--you know things that are beautiful and</p>
<p>terrible--and yet you are quiet--help me, Bertha--I know so</p>
<p>little--only that I am a bad, bad girl--and afraid--Bertha--afraid--"</p>
<p>"You poor little one--you bane walking in your sleep?"</p>
<p>"No. No. I'm not asleep. I'm not dreaming. I'm afraid,</p>
<p>Bertha--keep me here with you. Hold me--don't let go--don't let</p>
<p>him--get me--Bertha--"</p>
<p>She was like a child in a storm flung there against the rock of</p>
<p>Bertha, crying there and clinging there and shuddering there.</p>
<p>"You little thing--you yoost shivering--you bane sick--I go and call</p>
<p>Mr. Mus--"</p>
<p>She was a flash then, out of Bertha's arms, halfway across the room,</p>
<p>her gown a quick ripple of silk about her body, and her arms out</p>
<p>toward the window with a gesture of destination.</p>
<p>"Don't open that door! If you call him, I'll jump. I can't stand it</p>
<p>if you open that door. I'll jump out!"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Musliner. Baby. Wait! I won't open it. You bane sick. I</p>
<p>keep care of you. So. So. Here, in my bed--yoost shivering--yoost</p>
<p>shivering--"</p>
<p>She carried her bodily, a curving petal, toward the cot.</p>
<p>"Don't let him get me, Bertha."</p>
<p>"Poor little baby. Here please, if you don't mind--on my cot--you</p>
<p>bane chilled."</p>
<p>It was still warm there from the sag of Bertha's body. A nest of</p>
<p>coarse bedding that grated through Mrs. Musliner's film of gown.</p>
<p>"Let me go get you soft blankets. Mine bane stiff like a board."</p>
<p>"No. No. Don't leave me, Bertha. I like it hard. I want it</p>
<p>stiff--like a board. Like a cross. Like you. To hurt with the</p>
<p>hardness and not have it matter. Don't leave me, Bertha, stay with</p>
<p>me close. You understand, Bertha. He mustn't come near--I couldn't</p>
<p>stand it. He's so brown. A brown dog scratching at my door.</p>
<p>Scratching. Scratching--night after night--all these months. I</p>
<p>can't endure it. To-night--I--it seemed to me--he had a key! I</p>
<p>thought I heard him fumbling out there with one but--he wouldn't do</p>
<p>that--would he, Bertha--he wouldn't do that?"</p>
<p>"No. No."</p>
<p>"But he kept turning the knob--and scratching--that terrible</p>
<p>scratching--and then--something--that sound in the lock--like a</p>
<p>key--hold me, Bertha."</p>
<p>"Oh, Mrs. Musliner--don't be afraid--"</p>
<p>"I am, Bertha. I am. You understand. He mustn't come--I can't</p>
<p>stand it. Ever since we're married--I have managed so--never to be</p>
<p>alone--never to be alone. I shouldn't ever have done it. They</p>
<p>forced me. My father--family--money--he's so brown, Bertha--so</p>
<p>terribly brown--brown lips--so good and so brown and so terrible.</p>
<p>Help me, Bertha. You understand. You somehow--you--you cook--you</p>
<p>understand."</p>
<p>Bertha did. Dumbly. Mutely. And in a way that wound like a cry</p>
<p>around her heart.</p>
<p>"Poor Mrs. Musliner," she wanted to say, frightened by the wetted</p>
<p>lips and inexorable eyes of the cyclorama, even when they only shone</p>
<p>at her through the little pink jungle. Hers not to reason why.</p>
<p>Nature's big impervious scheme for her had no concern with the</p>
<p>shrinking of her flesh beyond that she must beget flesh.</p>
<p>"He bane good man."</p>
<p>"I know it, Bertha--that's what makes it so hard. Bertha--I want to</p>
<p>go away--there's someone--Bertha, come closer--there's someone--"</p>
<p>"The Young Fellow," said Bertha, and looked at her and made deeper</p>
<p>the cradle of her arms about her--"Oh, Mrs. Musliner--yoost open the</p>
<p>brown door."</p>
<p>"I can't, Bertha. I've tried and I can't."</p>
<p>"Yoost lay and get quiet."</p>
<p>"You're so deep and still, Bertha. Like snow. I never</p>
<p>noticed--before----"</p>
<p>"Shh-h-h, you little one. Don't shiver so. Let me go, yoost over</p>
<p>there to the cupboard to get you my coat, it bane hard here----"</p>
<p>"I want it hard--Bertha--hard and cold--I'm bad--and it's cool and</p>
<p>clean and meek to lay myself on wood--like you, Bertha--you're so</p>
<p>meek--why are you so meek, Bertha?"</p>
<p>"I--I do not know."</p>
<p>"Hold me. You're so still. Hold me. I never noticed how deep and</p>
<p>still you are. Ah, it's good. Hold me, Bertha."</p>
<p>She began to tremble softly into tears, the hard little rod of her</p>
<p>body relaxing.</p>
<p>"I'm no good, Bertha. Why don't I die?'</p>
<p>"You bane very good, Little Mrs."</p>
<p>"He's good. I'm bad. He's so good to me, Bertha, I can't bear it.</p>
<p>I can't bear him. His lips. Help me, Bertha."</p>
<p>Bertha, help her. Why, she wanted to. Bertha, who could pull webby</p>
<p>stuffs out of drainpipes to the sound of chimes goldily, how she</p>
<p>wanted to tell her of those inner secret solaces that rest in the</p>
<p>lovely grail of the spirit! Yet all the words that would come were:</p>
<p>"He bane good--open the brown door--"</p>
<p>"Listen! There he comes. Down the hall. Don't let him in, Bertha.</p>
<p>I couldn't stand it. Don't. I'll jump out the window first. Don't</p>
<p>let him in. Don't let him in."</p>
<p>All the rigidity was back and she clung in a tense hammock, her knees</p>
<p>braced up against Bertha, her arms up and locked about her neck.</p>
<p>"Save me, Bertha. Save me."</p>
<p>To the convulsive rigidity of the small figure in her arms, Mr.</p>
<p>Musliner's voice as gray and as flat as a moor came through the door:</p>
<p>"Erna."</p>
<p>She clung tighter, stifling her sobs against the hurting silence of</p>
<p>Bertha.</p>
<p>"Erna. Go back to your room."</p>
<p>Frantic little sob-racked whispers. "Tell him, Bertha--I can't</p>
<p>ever--can't, can't ever----"</p>
<p>"She's yoost a little nervous, Mr. Musliner. Maybe if you would</p>
<p>please go away for a while--maybe a little later she--will come----"</p>
<p>"Never. Bertha, tell him for me--can't--can't ever--not to be</p>
<p>angry--but--can't----"</p>
<p>"She says in yoost a little while, Mr. Musliner--if you will please</p>
<p>go away, in a little while I will bring her back."</p>
<p>"No. No. No. I didn't say it, Ben--I can't--can't----"</p>
<p>"Take Mrs. Musliner back to her room, Bertha, and stay with her</p>
<p>there--all night. I am going to my room now and inside of ten</p>
<p>minutes I shall expect to hear her go into hers--and lock the door."</p>
<p>His footsteps went off into the same thin silence as his coldly thin</p>
<p>voice, Mrs. Musliner shuddering down into a state of silence that was</p>
<p>more like a faint.</p>
<p>"Come--Mrs. Musliner."</p>
<p>"No. No. No."</p>
<p>"He bane good----"</p>
<p>"I know it, Bertha, but so brown--so terribly, terribly brown----."</p>
<p>To find the words to whisper to her of the little vibratory paths</p>
<p>that cut through the brown clay of externals...</p>
<p>"Yoost so the heart is not brown...."</p>
<p>"I know, Bertha, but I can't find my way there. It's so dark--I've</p>
<p>tried."</p>
<p>"Come, little Mrs., I'll take you...."</p>
<p>"You can't. Nobody can."</p>
<p>"I can--little Mrs.----"</p>
<p>They sat still, crouched in the gold-powdered darkness, heartbeat to</p>
<p>heartbeat. The sobs died down. Tears cooled and chapped little</p>
<p>pathways along her cheeks. Bertha spread-kneed in her flannels, and</p>
<p>the heavy gray petticoat. Barefoot.</p>
<p>"Oh Bertha--Bertha--so quiet--here with you. Hold me closer."</p>
<p>The Laocoön of them wound arm in arm there on the side of the cot.</p>
<p>Colder. Later. Stiller.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Musliner----"</p>
<p>"Let me rest, Bertha, here with you--I feel so still. Stiller than I</p>
<p>have ever been."</p>
<p>"It is already the ten minutes----"</p>
<p>"I--can't----"</p>
<p>"Come----"</p>
<p>"How----"</p>
<p>"With me."</p>
<p>She was like someone very quiet with a lovely kind of fatigue.</p>
<p>Swoony. No remonstrance to the blanket thrown three cornered across</p>
<p>her shoulders and the little journey, half propped against Bertha,</p>
<p>through the chilled tile and linoleum of the kitchen.</p>
<p>At Mr. Musliner's door Bertha put up her hand and knocked suddenly.</p>
<p>"Oh God--no--not there--" cried Mrs. Musliner, and reared back.</p>
<p>"This is the way--little Mrs."</p>
<p>"No--no!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh God," cried Mrs. Musliner again, but suddenly she stood silent</p>
<p>and waiting.</p>
<p>After a second Mr. Musliner opened the door. He was in a dressing</p>
<p>gown that roped around his waist and his face seemed to look out</p>
<p>brownly from behind the white mist of his pallor.</p>
<p>"Ben I--I----"</p>
<p>"She wants to come in, Mr. Musliner----"</p>
<p>"Ben--I--please. You. Me. My dear. Ben--may I open--the door--and</p>
<p>come in? May I--Ben?" she said, and stepped with a little rush over</p>
<p>the sill.</p>
<p>The door closing on them sent a little sigh of air out over Bertha</p>
<p>and left her standing in the river of the narrow hall's darkness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Snow smother, as if the morning had taken a deep breath and could not</p>
<p>let go. Almost the odor of Sunday, because not even the milk carts</p>
<p>were able to be abroad and, opening the dumb-waiter a spiral of snow</p>
<p>flew up like a jack-in-the-box and hit Bertha a good morning.</p>
<p>A white hearse of a day. Ice tesselated.</p>
<p>There were no breakfast rolls on the dumb-waiter and before Julie and</p>
<p>Lulu came down to clutter up the silence with talk, she began to mix</p>
<p>biscuit, squatting with the bowl caught between her knees, her</p>
<p>fingers webbing up with dough.</p>
<p>Presently, early even for him, and cautiously, before the arrival of</p>
<p>Lulu and Julie, Mr. Musliner came in. She wanted somehow not to have</p>
<p>to look at him, and could feel the ox-blood color of her flush as she</p>
<p>bent low over her mixing.</p>
<p>His shoes were brown with tan uppers and she could almost see in them</p>
<p>a new firm planting on the ground as he stood there before her.</p>
<p>Pride of the male.</p>
<p>"Bertha." he said, and clearing his throat slid his hand down into</p>
<p>his right pocket.</p>
<p>She wanted to help him and his scorching discomfort, but her eyes</p>
<p>were glued as if by the dough and would not lift.</p>
<p>"Bertha--I--Mrs. Musliner is very much better this morning."</p>
<p>"Yah--so."</p>
<p>"A little nervousness last night--you understand. Over tired. Bad</p>
<p>dreams--quite recovered this morning."</p>
<p>"Yah--yah--so--"</p>
<p>"... closing up the place here and taking a trip to Europe for the</p>
<p>change--nervous--needs a rest."</p>
<p>"Yah--yah--so? What?"</p>
<p>"... might be easier if you would leave here immediately--before she</p>
<p>has occasion to see you again. You understand--nervous condition--"</p>
<p>"Yah--yah--so--"</p>
<p>"Extra month's wages--references--good girl--but after what has</p>
<p>happened, embarrassing for all--you understand--going to Europe</p>
<p>anyhow--good girl--go now, before Mrs. Musliner awakens--good</p>
<p>girl--extra month's wages--"</p>
<p>"Yah--yah--so--"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day might have been a spark struck off clashing steel, so coldly</p>
<p>blue it met Bertha.</p>
<p>Almost immediately her fingers began to ache around the handle of her</p>
<p>carpetbag and she could feel the wire-stemmed rose on her hat</p>
<p>thridding with still-cold.</p>
<p>It was like being awakened out of a warm dream. For a moment she</p>
<p>could not place where she was. What next? Which way? Nothing to</p>
<p>suggest traffic. A white nun of a day standing impasse to the march</p>
<p>of the city.</p>
<p>An early bird of a boy, a demon with the joy of the storm, flung a</p>
<p>snowball at her, missing her so closely that she could taste the</p>
<p>whizz.</p>
<p>"Hello, Square-Head! Square-Head!" And then as the thin air passed</p>
<p>it along and along after her as she hurried: "Hello, Sq-q-uare</p>
<p>Head--Sq-q-quare Head."</p>
<p>The wind had a long whizz to it. Zeouw! It raced around corners, so</p>
<p>that it struck her broadsides and jerked her breath away. It rose up</p>
<p>under her hat and set it on end like a plate on a juggler's brow. It</p>
<p>sent up spiral snow ghosts in front of her and blew flurries of them</p>
<p>into her mouth. It caught at her skirts and tore up under, chapping</p>
<p>her knees. It tweaked her ears until the lobes were red and swollen</p>
<p>and shiny. Zeouw! The Inverness cape went up over her head like an</p>
<p>inside out umbrella and her skirts blew forward and the outline of</p>
<p>her big legs sprang out. A gilt boot over a cobbler's shop blew down</p>
<p>and grazed her by an inch. She was winded and twisted and the</p>
<p>carpetbag hooked into burningly cold fingers when she finally</p>
<p>staggered into a drug store. There was a pot-bellied stove with an</p>
<p>iron fence around it. Her flesh began to sing. She cupped her hands</p>
<p>against the warm, sheet-iron fence. All ten of her fingers, little</p>
<p>bells ringing. Tears of cold, that the wind had lashed to her</p>
<p>cheeks, started to thaw and run down. She began to fumble for her</p>
<p>handkerchief with the ten bells of fingers that would not stop</p>
<p>ringing.</p>
<p>The chemist, holding a measuring glass to the light and dripping into</p>
<p>it a colorless liquid from a large bottle, glanced up and shrugged</p>
<p>softly in his seersucker coat.</p>
<p>"Worst blizzard in ten years."</p>
<p>"Yah," she said, with her mouth full of the chattering dice of her</p>
<p>teeth.</p>
<p>"Where you going? You won't get a train out of this town to-day.</p>
<p>Worst tie-up in ten years."</p>
<p>"No. No. I got to go down to Front Street."</p>
<p>"Front Street? Docks, huh? You have as much chance getting down to</p>
<p>Front Street as a duck has of swimming through snowdrifts."</p>
<p>"I got to go," she said.</p>
<p>He looked at her over his glasses. He had a Yankee face with a</p>
<p>kick-up of beard.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, back to the old country?"</p>
<p>"Back? I've never been."</p>
<p>"Aint's you a Finn or something? You look as foreign to me as a</p>
<p>samovar. Got some foreign streaks in you, I'll wager."</p>
<p>"Many--but I don't know--all mixed--."</p>
<p>"Melting pot--eh? Well, it's a bad morning to have going anywhere on</p>
<p>your mind. Worst in ten years."</p>
<p>"I'm yoost changing places."</p>
<p>"Oh--housework?"</p>
<p>"Cook mostly."</p>
<p>"Whose firing a good, hefty girl like you on such a morning?"</p>
<p>"Not fired. I got references."</p>
<p>"Say, I have a customer over on Fifty-eighth Street needs a</p>
<p>cook--worst way! Small family. Good wages. I'm putting up these</p>
<p>aromatic spirits now for the old woman. You might take it over for</p>
<p>me and size up the place. Want the address--good folks?"</p>
<p>"If you will please be so good--."</p>
<p>He ran his tongue over a label, smacking it on to the bottle. "No</p>
<p>slip-ups on the way over. I'm taking a chance on you. My delivery</p>
<p>boy wouldn't miss the chance of staying away for a snowstorm like</p>
<p>this if he lived upstairs. Here's the name and address--."</p>
<p>She took the slip with her thick numbed fingers.</p>
<p>"Wall-en-stein--."</p>
<p>"Just around the corner. Tell them I sent you. He's the owner of</p>
<p>the Sample Shoe Store on Thirty-fourth Street."</p>
<p>She felt it incumbent upon her to purchase something, her eyes roving</p>
<p>along the shiny convex surface of a glass case. Rows of scented</p>
<p>toilet soaps shaped like the bodies of birds and made to cut softly</p>
<p>into the water. Perfumes. Bottle after bottle, the fragrance</p>
<p>throttled down with white membranous hoods. Sponges with gaping</p>
<p>thirsty little mouths. Things. Things that were sweet to the flesh.</p>
<p>Bertha had never owned of them.</p>
<p>"I'll have that," she said and pointed down into the case. It did</p>
<p>not matter.</p>
<p>"You don't want to buy anything," he said, and reached in for a cake</p>
<p>of the soap, slipping it into her hand. "I don't want you to take</p>
<p>something just to be polite. Have that on me. You're a nice girl.</p>
<p>They'll be lucky to get you. Wish I could afford you for the wife.</p>
<p>Don't forget the package."</p>
<p>She picked up her bag.</p>
<p>"Want to leave it here--in case--"</p>
<p>"Oh no," she said, "I don't mind," and curving her sore fingers again</p>
<p>about the handle, went out.</p>
<p>The wind met her with a swoop and a yell, standing her hat again up</p>
<p>on end. She bent into it, baring her teeth with the effort. The</p>
<p>elliptical shaped bar of soap was in her palm. It had pleasant</p>
<p>dimension. The smooth little blob of soap, shaped as an egg would</p>
<p>feel if it came whole out of your mouth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Wallensteins, where Bertha was to remain several years, lived on</p>
<p>the fifth floor. There were two middle-aged men in uniform in the</p>
<p>lower foyer, and pressed leatherette walls with grape-and-leaf design</p>
<p>embossed into them. What was really a small black onyx fountain in</p>
<p>the center of the lower hall was kept filled with artificial daisies,</p>
<p>and odds and ends belonging to the elevator men were surreptitiously</p>
<p>tucked under the cotton moss.</p>
<p>The Wallenstein living room overlooked the heads of the buildings</p>
<p>opposite and took in a fleeting view of Central Park with an etching</p>
<p>of tree, a pagoda on a rock, and a round of lake with a swan boat</p>
<p>floating upon it. A showy room of the shiny, overstuffed leather</p>
<p>furniture of the period. Velour hangings with tassels. A handsome</p>
<p>baby grand piano and a lamp with an openwork brass shade. Paintings</p>
<p>in shadow boxes and, incongruously enough, to fill in the narrow</p>
<p>panel of wall between the mantelpiece and door, a few Japanese prints</p>
<p>which Mr. Wallenstein had once been obliged to take over as part</p>
<p>payment of a bad account. Cool and thin with the fine calligraphy of</p>
<p>a minute and apparently emotionless art. Bare-legged coolies full of</p>
<p>little running steps. The span of many bridges. A plum tree,</p>
<p>botanically wrong. A peacock, ornithologically wrong. Slant faces</p>
<p>hung on like masks. Bertha liked to dust their impassiveness.</p>
<p>Evenings when there was not a poker party around the dining-room</p>
<p>table, the Wallensteins lounged about this room in loose unexcited</p>
<p>attitudes. Mr. Wallenstein reading the paper and yawning enormously</p>
<p>with protracted shudderings as he turned the pages. He was a tall,</p>
<p>heavy-set fellow, with very black hair parted down the center and set</p>
<p>on to his head squarely, like a toupee. His small, straight mustache</p>
<p>with the ends waxed up enhanced this squareness. When he stretched</p>
<p>out in his long hypothenuse and hoisted the newspaper, he littered</p>
<p>the entire center of the room, and to pass him, one had to climb.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wallenstein, on these evenings when there was no poker game,</p>
<p>uncorseted herself immediately after dinner, the soft white flesh</p>
<p>running down the hill of her body. She was very blonde, and wore her</p>
<p>hair in an elaborate tier upon tier of puffs. These puffs, made in</p>
<p>rows of three, four, and five, like hot buns, cluttered the house.</p>
<p>So much as open a drawer and one crawled out at you and wound itself</p>
<p>around your fingers in a webby, highly unpleasant fashion. Once Mr.</p>
<p>Wallenstein slid into a row of them that had somehow dropped into his</p>
<p>shoe, and forthwith had the noisy horrors.</p>
<p>Whenever old Mrs. Wallenstein found one, she picked it up gingerly,</p>
<p>as if it were a mouse by the tail, and handed it in a scathing kind</p>
<p>of silence to her daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>"Pfui!" was how she felt about most things pertaining to her son's</p>
<p>wife. But she sat, too, in the living room with the pair of them</p>
<p>after dinner. There was an arch of shadow where the lamplight did</p>
<p>not reach. Old Mrs. Wallenstein liked to sit back in that, idle and</p>
<p>brooding and with dry old eyes like prunes.</p>
<p>She had to have a hassock, because her feet did not touch the floor.</p>
<p>Young Mrs. Wallenstein had a way of kicking the hassock savagely when</p>
<p>her mother-in-law was not about, gritting her teeth with pain at her</p>
<p>stubbed toes and taking a fierce kind of delight in that pain, and</p>
<p>then kicking it again and again with her fancy tipped shoes.</p>
<p>Young Mrs. Wallenstein's shoes were eloquent. They were</p>
<p>short-vamped, florid, and after even one wearing apt to tipple a</p>
<p>little of run-over heels. Bertha was constantly at them with polish</p>
<p>and cleaning fluids and vaseline for the patent leather. There was</p>
<p>one pair of very high-heeled, slightly lop-sided champagne-colored</p>
<p>ones with black jigsaw trimming. Mrs. Wallenstein never failed with</p>
<p>her "pfui" when she passed them, smelling of cleaning fluid and</p>
<p>drying crookedly on the window sill. There was something suggestive</p>
<p>of blondely loose fat about their short vamps and run-over heels.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Wallenstein wore square-toed, black bluchers with rubber</p>
<p>insets, which she polished herself every morning and set on the fire</p>
<p>escape outside Bertha's window to dry.</p>
<p>Her son, who was inclined to bunions, wore square toes too, but with</p>
<p>the additional flourish of spats with the green or ruby of vivid hose</p>
<p>above them.</p>
<p>Underneath the dining room table, their respective feet spoke</p>
<p>volumes. The polished orthodox ones of old Mrs. Wallenstein on their</p>
<p>hassock. The short-vamp, champagne ones. Wallenstein's rather</p>
<p>stolid ones between the two.</p>
<p>Difficult, nervous meals of three kinds of silences. An old lady's</p>
<p>aching one. A young woman's high-tensioned one. Wallenstein's tired</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed to Bertha that the dining room of golden oak and</p>
<p>swell of elaborate sideboard was filled with a gale of this silence,</p>
<p>like one of those terrific arctic windstorms that old sea dogs dread</p>
<p>because the water, in horrible phenomena, lies like glass under the</p>
<p>gale too wind-beaten to lift a wave.</p>
<p>"Pass me the butter, Wally." Scarcely the phraseology to rock</p>
<p>empires, and yet, when May Wallenstein said it, old Mrs. Wallenstein,</p>
<p>whose skin was sapless at best, could seem to shrivel into the</p>
<p>ancient parchment of the Torah.</p>
<p>She kept kosher. Valiantly. The forbidden combination of meat and</p>
<p>butter might desecrate her daughter-in-law's board, but not the</p>
<p>spirit nor the palate of the old lady. At her end of the table the</p>
<p>sacred rituals of the "_fleischig_" and "_milchig_" remained</p>
<p>unviolated. There was a shelf in the kitchen, especially contrived</p>
<p>by her son, for the kosher utensils and a two-burner gas-stove in the</p>
<p>corner for the personal and private preparation of her orthodox foods.</p>
<p>May hated that stove and the little whisper of garlic that hung above</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>"Makes me sick to my stummick to walk into my own kitchen" was her</p>
<p>frequent _sotto voce_. "I'm Episcopalian, but I'd like to see myself</p>
<p>frying myself Episcopalian pork chops. Good to their stummicks! Oh,</p>
<p>Lord! Kosher is another word for stummick-love."</p>
<p>And Bertha, hearing, would clatter pans and turn on the spigot for</p>
<p>the plunge of water into the sink, because sometimes the undertones</p>
<p>percolated to the old woman's dim ears and then she had one of her</p>
<p>smothering spells and spirits of ammonia had to be administered. On</p>
<p>one occasion, Mr. Wallenstein, in the midst of a Monday marked-down</p>
<p>sale of Oxford-ties had to be sent for, and all through the rush</p>
<p>hours was obliged to sit alternating between holding his mother's</p>
<p>hand in her darkened bedroom and pacifying his wife, who invariably</p>
<p>expressed her frenzy by throwing articles of clothing into a</p>
<p>traveling bag and then strewing them all out again. It kept Bertha</p>
<p>on the jump, what with the hot water bag for the old lady's numb feet</p>
<p>and picking up the young one's distracted articles of finery.</p>
<p>"No. I won't be the one to go. Why should I? That's just what</p>
<p>she's laying for, to break up this house. But she won't! Not while</p>
<p>my dress buttons up the back with tiddlywinks!"</p>
<p>The last was a favorite aphorism of Mrs. Wallenstein. You could hear</p>
<p>it from the poker table:</p>
<p>"I'll raise you two bones. You can't bluff me. Not while my dress</p>
<p>buttons up the back with tiddlywinks." Or over the telephone to her</p>
<p>sister, who clerked in the Sample Shoe Store: "Tell Wally his mother</p>
<p>is fixing him one of his sweet-sour messes for his supper and to stop</p>
<p>by and bring me home a couple of chops for mine. I wouldn't eat</p>
<p>anything sweet and sour for no man. No siree, not while my dress</p>
<p>buttons up the back with tiddlywinks!"</p>
<p>A gay painted phrase like the little pagoda all lantern-hung in one</p>
<p>of the Japanese prints. Bertha liked it. Button up the back with</p>
<p>tiddlywinks! To be sure, May didn't button up that way at all, but</p>
<p>with much holding in at the waist and reddening of the face, and</p>
<p>exclamations like "Ouch, watch out, let me straighten my shields</p>
<p>first. A little elbow grease will help."</p>
<p>The fastenings were usually blobby velvet ones or hooks that strained</p>
<p>at their moorings.</p>
<p>To button up the back with tiddlywinks was to be gay as a striped</p>
<p>tent. It made Bertha feel gay somehow, just to repeat it to herself;</p>
<p>as gay as the day the river ran ahead of the furniture van to show</p>
<p>them the way to the grove.</p>
<p>But, generally, there was little enough to feel gay about at the</p>
<p>Wallensteins, with May and her tantrums so quick on the trigger, or</p>
<p>the broody old woman who on Friday evenings would light the candles</p>
<p>in her room and keep open her door so that the sound of her weeping</p>
<p>came in little bleatings down the hallway.</p>
<p>"She's putting on, putting on," May would sing-song, as she lolled</p>
<p>_en déshabillé_ in the living room. She had a perpetually hoarse</p>
<p>voice, full of fog. "When I feel like having a good cry, I go in my</p>
<p>room and shut the door, and God knows there's enough reasons around</p>
<p>here for having a good cry. Evening's diversion. God, how they love</p>
<p>to cry. It's a wonder there's not an Atlantic Ocean somewheres made</p>
<p>up of noisy kosher tears."</p>
<p>"I wish you'd leave my mother out of your gab, May."</p>
<p>"Oh, you do, do you? Well then, I wish she'd leave her gab out of my</p>
<p>business!"</p>
<p>"Between you and your rows you two women are driving me plumb raving</p>
<p>crazy. At least if I was the youngest I'd give in to an old</p>
<p>woman--like my mother with only a few years left to live. I'd humor</p>
<p>her, May. Honest I would."</p>
<p>"Few years. Long enough to have ruined my home for years! Few</p>
<p>years! With her digestion for the greasy meals she eats, she stands</p>
<p>a good chance of ruining it for many years to come."</p>
<p>"I won't stand hearing my mother talked about in language that's only</p>
<p>fit for a bar-room. This isn't the Bowery. It's supposed to be a</p>
<p>home where a man who's been on his feet all day can get a minute's</p>
<p>peace."</p>
<p>"What about me? Am I entitled to a little peace in my own home, too?</p>
<p>That old woman is driving me crazy. I can't get no friends to come</p>
<p>to the house no more the way she sits out in the next room yammering</p>
<p>to herself--I won't turn kosher for nobody's old woman. You married</p>
<p>me for what I was and my Episcopalian hide is as precious to me as</p>
<p>her kosher one! This isn't a home. It's a hell-house."</p>
<p>"May, you can't change a leopard's spots. My mother's old, and she's</p>
<p>grieving herself to death over things you're too young to understand.</p>
<p>She likes you, May."</p>
<p>"A lot I care if she likes me or not. Nobody could live in the house</p>
<p>with her. The dusting don't suit and the cooking don't suit and the</p>
<p>poker parties don't suit and the number of petticoats I have in the</p>
<p>wash don't suit. Bertha is the first servant we've ever been able to</p>
<p>keep in the same house with your mother and if that big lummox is</p>
<p>human I'll button my dress up the back with tiddlywinks...."</p>
<p>"She's the best servant we ever had."</p>
<p>"Yes, but nobody but a great, cream-colored elephant like her would</p>
<p>stand for the old woman's butting in. She's got a hide not even your</p>
<p>mother can break through. That's the way to be. Tough, so that they</p>
<p>can stick things in you and you don't feel 'em. I'm sensitive.</p>
<p>That's me. High-strung. I can't stand no yammering old hex in my</p>
<p>affairs, and not get the jimjams."</p>
<p>"You eat those words that you just called my mother."</p>
<p>"Eat 'em? I'll spit 'em out, you mean! Hex--that's what she is.</p>
<p>Hex!"</p>
<p>"By God--"</p>
<p>"All right, hit me! Hit me! Lots I care--go in there and cry some</p>
<p>kosher tears with her--I can't help it because your father died--I</p>
<p>can't help it because garlic makes me sick to my stummick--I can't</p>
<p>help it because a penny don't look the size of a sunrise to me--hit</p>
<p>me--hit me--but if you do, there'll be the greatest little smash-up</p>
<p>around here this happy home has ever known--hit me--I'd like to see</p>
<p>you try it, Sheenie!"</p>
<p>"By God--you--"</p>
<p>"Ah--ow--"</p>
<p>Then, to Bertha shuddering in the kitchen, the tormented frenzied</p>
<p>tumble of him down the hallway, the slam into his room and presently</p>
<p>the horrid distressed sounds of the violent sickness which these</p>
<p>scenes never failed to induce in him.</p>
<p>Silence, with May lying swollen and wet-mouthed on the couch, and the</p>
<p>bleating from the old woman's room whimpering down into sobs.</p>
<p>Virtually, it was Bertha who put the family to bed. Additional</p>
<p>blankets to be laid out. Pillows fluffed. The hot water bag for the</p>
<p>old woman's chilled spine. Ice for Wallenstein to suck. Spirits of</p>
<p>camphor for the threat of fever sore on May's swollen lips.</p>
<p>Yes, generally there was little enough to be glad about at the</p>
<p>Wallensteins.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In spring Bertha wheeled the old lady out in her rolling chair. She</p>
<p>had a hip-bone complaint and except in the house, seldom walked.</p>
<p>Bertha liked wheeling her out in the spring.</p>
<p>Usually because the up and down curbs were difficult, she trundled</p>
<p>her directly to the park.</p>
<p>There was a tree there beside the lake with the swan-boats on it,</p>
<p>that in April popped out in a delicate rash of leaves. It was down</p>
<p>eight steps hewn out of a natural rock, and sometimes old Mrs.</p>
<p>Wallenstein squealed at the tilt of the chair, but once down, there</p>
<p>was quite a little dell, and a bench beside the water so that when</p>
<p>one of the swan-boats moved the water ran up almost to the small</p>
<p>front wheels of the chair and then backed off again.</p>
<p>Long, sedative afternoons with the old woman droning into them and</p>
<p>Bertha, her hand joggling chair as if it were a perambulator,</p>
<p>watching the light bend around the lake. In repose the look of</p>
<p>tightness could seem to ease up in Mrs. Wallenstein's face like the</p>
<p>flesh of a prune that has been dropped in water.</p>
<p>Faces like hers, strong-skinned, high-boned, and the eyes a little</p>
<p>fanatical with love, had kept the storm-blown flames of the</p>
<p>seven-branch candlestick burning down through the ages.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Wallenstein wept for her son she wept for Israel, and that</p>
<p>is why her eyes could sometimes seem dry as salt beds with bitter</p>
<p>residuum.</p>
<p>Often, talking through the quiet afternoon, her lips would try to</p>
<p>shape themselves for words too heart-twisting for her to endure to</p>
<p>speak and so she would cry them, her mouth writhing back from the</p>
<p>gums.</p>
<p>"My boy. I don't care, Berthie, so much that she has stolen him from</p>
<p>me, every mother who loses a son to a wife must learn such pain, but</p>
<p>Berthie--she's stolen him from his faith--ain't that an awful pain,</p>
<p>Berthie, to have a son stolen like a baby from his cradle out of his</p>
<p>religion? Away from his God--to hers."</p>
<p>Here was that God business again. God--drenched in Light. Why was</p>
<p>Mrs. Wallenstein's God a better God than May's God? Why was not the</p>
<p>God who made May, the same God who made Mrs. Wallenstein and Bertha</p>
<p>and Mr. Musliner and--and Rollo and even Annie Wennerberg? All this</p>
<p>wrangling over your God and my God. God--drenched in Light. Or was</p>
<p>God Light? Then why this groping in the dark? Julie, the waitress,</p>
<p>had talked to her God along a string of beads. May Wallenstein went</p>
<p>out on saint days to visit hers. Mrs. Wallenstein burned candles and</p>
<p>kept her tongue free of the salt of swine in His name. One God and</p>
<p>yet all struggling over Him. Tearing Him to pieces and setting up</p>
<p>each his shred. Mrs. Wallenstein refuting May's Shred for her Shred.</p>
<p>Julie's Shred to be whispered to along a string of beads. Your</p>
<p>Shred. My Shred. Yet all torn off the divinely bleeding and</p>
<p>omnipotent form of God--drenched in Light. To sit in that Light and</p>
<p>soak it in through the pores--drowsily as the old woman talked--and</p>
<p>talked on--through the spring-lit afternoons.</p>
<p>"A boy who was raised in such a home like his should go out of it to</p>
<p>another religion! Not a Friday night in his life that he didn't see</p>
<p>his papa and me light the candles for our Shabbas. I'm afraid to</p>
<p>die. I'm afraid to die and leave him to face her God."</p>
<p>Silently then, Bertha would jounce the handle of the rolling chair.</p>
<p>"She's not right for him, Berthie. How I prayed with him that night</p>
<p>he came home from the dance-hall where he met her, he should not go</p>
<p>to such places--even before I knew where it would lead to. She ain't</p>
<p>a helpful wife, Berthie--like I was to mine. I stinted. She spends.</p>
<p>I mended and washed and ironed. She plays poker and eats all day,</p>
<p>chocolates. My boy works on his feet fifteen hours and she spends it</p>
<p>faster as he can earn it. He don't realize it yet--he's in love. It</p>
<p>ain't nice to say it--but he's in love just with her body--no man can</p>
<p>change his God for a woman's body--and have it last."</p>
<p>Talk--talk--talk--through the long sedative afternoons. Sometimes</p>
<p>Bertha dozed a little, coming up to consciousness for snatches of it</p>
<p>and then slipping off again, her head over toward one shoulder and</p>
<p>her hand automatically at the little sedative jouncing motion.</p>
<p>"You should have seen, Berthie--such a little new suit as his papa</p>
<p>bought him for _bar mitzvah_--to get _bar mitzvah_ by us is the holy</p>
<p>time when boy becomes a little man in his religion. His papa--how</p>
<p>every night after supper, in the back of the store so sometimes the</p>
<p>customers had to wait, my husband heard that child his _bar mitzvah_</p>
<p>lesson. And for what? Such a blonde shixsa what don't do nothing</p>
<p>except set him against his mother and his religion and throw out his</p>
<p>money for him faster as he can make it. Thank God his papa didn't</p>
<p>live to see it--maybe he blames me when we meet again--I couldn't</p>
<p>help it, Julius--I tried--I prayed--I tried--I prayed--she got him</p>
<p>with her white flesh, Julius--blonde flesh like he wasn't used to.</p>
<p>When a woman gets hold of a boy that way--ours--not even his</p>
<p>mother--or even his God, Julius--can hold him back--Julius--don't be</p>
<p>mad--I couldn't hold--him--back--he's a good boy--but I couldn't hold</p>
<p>him--back--"</p>
<p>And so on and on through the whimpering lips, until the copper band</p>
<p>of light around the lake snapped out and with a great pulling and</p>
<p>tugging and sometimes the help of a passerby, Bertha began to yank</p>
<p>the wheel chair up the steps that were hewn out of natural rock.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bertha's second summer there Wallenstein and his wife took a two</p>
<p>weeks' holiday at a small lake resort upstate known as Becker's</p>
<p>Point. May's second brother ran what they called "the pickle boat"</p>
<p>around the lake in summer. A small provision tug which puffed about</p>
<p>all day, dispensing from landing to landing, the tinned, the tabloid,</p>
<p>and the compressed foods of the summer colony.</p>
<p>"You would rather have your vacation, Wally, by Fleishmans in the</p>
<p>Catskills where you're used to it, but lots she cares where you get</p>
<p>your vacation just so she gets hers. Her brother with his store on a</p>
<p>boat! We're plain but substantial people. In our family we got our</p>
<p>stores on streets like it is legitimate."</p>
<p>Wallenstein took his mother by the wrists and pressed his fingers</p>
<p>into them until white areas sprang.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, mama, don't start anything with May now. I do want</p>
<p>to go to Becker's Point. I need a rest. I'm nervous. Damnably</p>
<p>nervous."</p>
<p>"I won't say anything, Wally, to her if I bust with it. I'm only</p>
<p>saying it to you--I know how you like it at Fleishmans in the</p>
<p>Catskills--"</p>
<p>"I'll send you there, ma--Bertha can take you--"</p>
<p>"Me? For myself, Wally, I'm satisfied to stay home and do a little</p>
<p>saving. But that you should have to lay around such a _goy_ place!"</p>
<p>"Ma, if I hear that hateful word from you one more time! I'm worn</p>
<p>out--I can't stand it--I'm nervous--you hear--"</p>
<p>"All right, Son. Don't holler. Maybe I won't be here so much longer</p>
<p>you should holler at me like that--if only I wasn't afraid to die and</p>
<p>meet papa--"</p>
<p>He dropped to one knee, kissing her hand.</p>
<p>"Mama, mama, don't torment me. I love her, mama, and</p>
<p>I--sometimes--I--I'm afraid--I hate her! That's torment for</p>
<p>you--torment of hell on earth. To love a woman at the same time that</p>
<p>you hate her!"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>So that summer for two weeks of an August that glared down upon the</p>
<p>city until it was as bleached and polished as old bone, Bertha and</p>
<p>Mrs. Wallenstein had the flat to themselves.</p>
<p>Hot, motionless days and nights that seemed to sit still and brood</p>
<p>like pyramids! For the time, Bertha slept on a cot at the foot of</p>
<p>the old woman's bed. She tossed a great deal and a little moan ran</p>
<p>through her light snores, and sometimes she started up with short,</p>
<p>sharp cries.</p>
<p>"Wally! Don't let her! Julius! It's _pesach_--Wally--don't eat</p>
<p>that bread! Shiksa! A shiksa wife! No, no, papa--I tried--I</p>
<p>begged. I prayed."</p>
<p>Often Bertha had to get up and turn on the light.</p>
<p>"You bane dreaming, Mrs. Wallenstein. See. It's Bertha. Here, let</p>
<p>me fix your pillows--take a sip of water--so--there's nobody here but</p>
<p>Bertha."</p>
<p>"I thought it was _pesach_, Bertha--when my people must eat only</p>
<p>_matzoths_--the unleavened bread of God--and she wouldn't let</p>
<p>me--Bertha."</p>
<p>"Shh-h-h, Mrs. Wallenstein."</p>
<p>"She stepped on them once," and up went the voice to the peak of</p>
<p>hysteria that was so hard to quell. "_Matzoths_. God's bread. I</p>
<p>can't ever forgive her that...."</p>
<p>And so on and so on and so on through the burning deserts of these</p>
<p>motionless August nights and sometimes, of sheer exhaustion, Bertha</p>
<p>slept. Vastly. With her cheek crumpled up against her arm, the</p>
<p>sheets thrown back from her body, and the great ridge of her</p>
<p>uncovered legs magnolia-white in the darkness.</p>
<p>One dawn a withered leaf fluttered down upon the heavy torpor of</p>
<p>Bertha. It was Mrs. Wallenstein's hand, plucking at her from across</p>
<p>the footboard of her bed.</p>
<p>"Berthie!"</p>
<p>"Oh--what--yes, Mrs. Wallenstein."</p>
<p>"Berthie, I been called home."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"I want to go, Berthie. It ain't long now before I won't be here no</p>
<p>more and before I go--I want to go back down there. It won't be so</p>
<p>hard I should have to face Julius if first I can only go home."</p>
<p>"Why, Mrs. Wallenstein, you bane home--here."</p>
<p>"Here is not home for me. Get me my foulard dress and my bonnet.</p>
<p>Quick! I want we should start before the heat of the day."</p>
<p>"But your son will not like it."</p>
<p>A sudden slyness came curling out in the old woman's face.</p>
<p>"No, he don't like it if I go, Berthie. It ain't stylish that his</p>
<p>old mother should remember old days, but Berthie, please, take me</p>
<p>home. I want more as anything to go. Only down by Division Street,</p>
<p>Berthie?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wallenstein--you can't walk--"</p>
<p>"Look, Berthie--when I got ambition, see how I can walk--see,</p>
<p>Berthie--please--"</p>
<p>And sure enough, she began to limp about, outlandish in her</p>
<p>nightdress, with the rack of her old body shaking through, but her</p>
<p>face thrust out ahead of herself, like a lantern.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wallenstein--your son--I promised to take good care--"</p>
<p>She was slyer and slyer, her eyebrows running up into little peaks</p>
<p>and her cheek bones and chin jutting out into points.</p>
<p>"He don't got to know, Berthie. Take me home, Berthie, before I die.</p>
<p>I'm going to die--soon. I hear it at nights underneath my sleep.</p>
<p>And you know what it is, Berthie, to hear things--that way. Because</p>
<p>always you too are listening to something. I heard it again last</p>
<p>night--take me home, Berthie, so I can get strength back to meet</p>
<p>papa---I want my old home where we lived twenty years and where my</p>
<p>boy learned his _bar mitzvah_ lessons behind the counter--I want to</p>
<p>go back--"</p>
<p>And Bertha washed the old face of its tear traces, brushed back the</p>
<p>old hair into thin streaks that scarcely covered the scalp, and</p>
<p>fastened around her the decent silk foulard dress.</p>
<p>The August day came out at them like a parched and coated tongue as</p>
<p>they started for Division Street.</p>
<p>The wheels ran and banged, and a breeze that smelled of armpits and</p>
<p>little babies, milk-soaked bibs and bedding that had been sweated</p>
<p>into, blew through the street car. A breeze as curiously alive as</p>
<p>breath.</p>
<p>It stood the little invisible nap of fine hairs on Bertha's forearm</p>
<p>up on end in an electric little rash and it rushed against her ears,</p>
<p>thick with words that could not form themselves out of the two dozen</p>
<p>languages that the East Side exuded. A conglomerate breath, rich in</p>
<p>nationalities and that would one day find voice. Bertha knew that</p>
<p>rich kind of muteness. It beat up against her so.</p>
<p>At Canal Street it was as if the sidewalks ran shouting to meet them.</p>
<p>It was hard to steady Mrs. Wallenstein against the dizzying swirl,</p>
<p>because she was crying and through the dimness of tears wading her</p>
<p>way eastward, her umbrella, which she carried as a steadying cane,</p>
<p>waving out before her as if to clear the way of children and languid</p>
<p>puffs of dirty newspaper and rinds and rinds of fruits.</p>
<p>"Ten years since I been home, Berthie. How I worked when I was a</p>
<p>young woman down here to get ourselves out of it and now I got myself</p>
<p>out of it how I eat my heart to be back in it. My boy was _bar</p>
<p>mitzvah_ down here. My husband made us a living down here. My</p>
<p>happiest days in my life I spent down here with my people. Hurry,</p>
<p>Berthie. I want to get home. It's two blocks only now. I want you</p>
<p>should see where my baby was born--"</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Wallenstein. Suddenly full of young little running</p>
<p>steps--two long raspberry ovals of color out in her cheeks, the</p>
<p>foulard dress ballooning as she hurried. Tears. Tears. Tears.</p>
<p>Thick lenses of them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The house in Division Street was as lean as a witch. Human bodies,</p>
<p>lax, like pillows over sills, dangling and shouting from windows.</p>
<p>That dingy and perpetual banner of poverty, the family wash line,</p>
<p>kicking and writhing. There was a poultry store on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Strong smells of chicken blood and hot fuzz, and on the high stoop,</p>
<p>like a brooding conclave of the shawled women of the east, half a</p>
<p>dozen old crones in white headkerchiefs and burning back deeply in</p>
<p>them--deeply, burningly back, tired Old-Testament eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mrs. Wallenstein's legs gave out under her. They would not</p>
<p>climb that stoop. Twice, with Bertha's sturdy hand at her elbow, she</p>
<p>raised her foot for the first step and twice her knees doubled under,</p>
<p>until finally she crumpled up on the first step, leaning her face</p>
<p>against the railing to cry.</p>
<p>"I can't go no further. I'm too happy. I'm home. This is my stoop.</p>
<p>I don't know no more these faces, but this is my stoop."</p>
<p>And the snow of hot fuzz blew against her lips, and children, filthy</p>
<p>with the fruit-rinds of the littered streets, gathered around, and</p>
<p>the biblical old women with their peering faces and dead-leaf hands</p>
<p>came down the steps, and Mrs. Wallenstein, laughing and crying, held</p>
<p>out her arms to them and they drew back shyly.</p>
<p>Then came an avalanche of words. Words. A torrent of them that were</p>
<p>new and alien to Bertha. Words that she had never heard before.</p>
<p>Down off the chute of Mrs. Wallenstein's tongue they came, tumbling</p>
<p>in Yiddish. Coals off a chute. Clatter. Clatter. And the circle</p>
<p>of the old women closed in, and off ran the children, uninterested in</p>
<p>just another conclave of the elders. And the sun grew hotter and</p>
<p>higher and the din ground itself against the flesh like grime, and</p>
<p>Bertha sat by waiting, while the whining voices of the old women, in</p>
<p>a circle now on the lowermost step, wove on and on.</p>
<p>The heat was like a boil, gathering and throbbing into the head of</p>
<p>high noon, and still the children shouted and the bodies that hung</p>
<p>across window sills pointed and shrieked down to them. Pushcarts</p>
<p>began to leak of their softening and rotting fruits; old men dozed</p>
<p>into their beards; cats slept in the attitude of death, but with</p>
<p>palpitating sides. A tailor sat on his ironing board reading the</p>
<p>newspaper in which his half-eaten herring sandwich was wrapped, and</p>
<p>played up and down on his small pocket piccolo, the thin grieving</p>
<p>notes of the desert.</p>
<p>Oi--oi--the high quail voices of the old women--the dry old women</p>
<p>past childbearing and with the dry eyes and the dry breasts and the</p>
<p>dry tears.</p>
<p>Bertha began to walk. Banners waved. The banners of the flying</p>
<p>gibbets of leggy underwear from high clothes lines. The jargon of</p>
<p>Yiddish ran in a tide. More and more old women on hot high stoops.</p>
<p>The life of the children close down to sidewalks with the rinds and</p>
<p>the drip from the fruit carts.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Prince Street, little Italy, the women with the pot</p>
<p>bellies of more and more child bearing, the men debonair with the</p>
<p>blackness of hair and the whiteness of teeth. Curving scimitar of</p>
<p>Chinese Pell Street, the shape of a mandarin's little-finger nail;</p>
<p>skins the color of apricots. Much further down ran Front Street with</p>
<p>its flotsam from the sea and still further down, West Street of the</p>
<p>water pipe and fez. Hot, disturbed breaths of alien climes, not</p>
<p>soluble one in another, but all soluble in the new world. And out of</p>
<p>the new world was one day to come the rich composite expression that</p>
<p>struggled so for articulation.</p>
<p>The words of the jeweled sands.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day was on the down side. Through the heat dance all the lean</p>
<p>houses seemed to have wavy walls, and it was not easy to manipulate</p>
<p>Mrs. Wallenstein back again to the street car. They had to let two</p>
<p>of them pass because again the old woman could not quite bring her</p>
<p>foot to raise for the step, but finally she made the hoist and</p>
<p>plumped down inside with a burst of perspiration.</p>
<p>Except for the sighs which blew and blew off the twisted old crags of</p>
<p>lips, she seemed to doze, with her fist plunged deep into Bertha's</p>
<p>palm and throbbing there.</p>
<p>"You seen, Berthie--my people--those are my people--and his--our</p>
<p>people. Berthie--who are your people?"</p>
<p>"My people?" She looked at her softly, the wide lips falling apart to</p>
<p>smile. "My people? Why those are my people," she said, her eyes</p>
<p>very blue and her lips fumbling to say more. "Those are my people.</p>
<p>Out there. All. Everywhere."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the last time the old woman ever left the house. August</p>
<p>roared on and Wallenstein and his wife returned. Bertha moved her</p>
<p>cot back into the breathless room that opened off the kitchen, and</p>
<p>the old woman resumed her long, motionless watches in the shadowy</p>
<p>arch between the folding doors. Sitting there during the long</p>
<p>merriments of the poker game, her dry eyes forever focused upon her</p>
<p>son, they could seem to smear into a single tearless and reproachful</p>
<p>orb in the center of her forehead.</p>
<p>"Gives me the jimjams--her sitting back there--" was another frequent</p>
<p>_sotto voce_ of May, her white flesh writhing up and down under the</p>
<p>large pearls and transparent chiffons she was fond of wearing.</p>
<p>"Mama dear, don't you think you had better let Bertha take you to</p>
<p>bed--we're going to play a round of rudles yet and you must be tired."</p>
<p>"I'm all right, son."</p>
<p>Once a guest, a Mr. McGuire, who was a frequent visitor, swung around</p>
<p>in his chair to her.</p>
<p>"Come on, Grandma, have one of these kosher ham sandwiches. They're</p>
<p>kosher, ain't they, Wally--."</p>
<p>Oh. Oh. Oh. The poor dried prunes of eyes in Mrs. Wallenstein's</p>
<p>head. They seemed to have died there.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One January noon when there were pork chops snapping on the stove for</p>
<p>lunch, Mrs. Wallenstein was suddenly missing from her rocking chair</p>
<p>beside the window in her room. She left there less and less now, and</p>
<p>never without the hoist of Bertha's arm.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wallenstein--the old woman--she's not in her room. I can't</p>
<p>find her."</p>
<p>May was drying her hair in a great fan that spread in a patch of cold</p>
<p>sunlight on the window sill.</p>
<p>"She's not far. No such luck."</p>
<p>Sure enough, Bertha finally discovered her shivering and crying on</p>
<p>the fire escape, where she had climbed with an agility that frenzy</p>
<p>alone could have given her.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wallenstein, you must come in from the cold."</p>
<p>"Let her stay out there, Bertha. She'll soon get enough of it, if</p>
<p>she sees she can't spite me by one of her loony fits."</p>
<p>"Quick--come in right away. That is not nice to sit in the cold."</p>
<p>"I can't stand it. She should cut out my heart to get rid of me, but</p>
<p>I can't stand it I should have to spend my days in such a household</p>
<p>where my son's home is made every minute an insult to his religion.</p>
<p>It's like my own heart was frying with them pork chops. Thank God</p>
<p>his papa didn't live to see it."</p>
<p>Bertha coaxed her in, dragging her a chair for the step from sill to</p>
<p>floor, and full of little urgings.</p>
<p>"There. Now. So."</p>
<p>"It would be better, Berthie, if I die to-morrow. Then I don't stand</p>
<p>any more in my son's way or in my daughter-in-law's."</p>
<p>"No, no, Mrs. Wallenstein."</p>
<p>"It's not good, Berthie, a woman should got to stand between such a</p>
<p>good son's happiness with his wife like I do. Only, Berthie, she</p>
<p>ain't his happiness--he don't know it--but I do. A man who has to</p>
<p>pay with his God for his love don't find no happiness. My poor</p>
<p>son--he don't know which he should be first. My son or her husband.</p>
<p>I'm in the way, Berthie. Nobody knows it better as I do. Berthie</p>
<p>... never leave me, Berthie...."</p>
<p>She needed Bertha so. Even the absurd fashion in which she</p>
<p>pronounced her name was like a cry in the dark. A little winged sob</p>
<p>that could beat its way and nest in Bertha's heart and hurt there.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night, long after the lights were out, the cry would</p>
<p>come through to her, and down she would tiptoe and curl up at the</p>
<p>foot of the old woman's bed, ponderous as a mastiff.</p>
<p>Wallenstein was grateful. He had her come down to his shoe store on</p>
<p>Thirty-fourth Street to be fitted for two fine strong pairs of</p>
<p>bluchers, and as she went out with the package under her arm, he said:</p>
<p>"Never leave my mother, Bertha, and you won't regret it. She's a</p>
<p>little peculiar in her ways and her ways aren't my wife's ways--but a</p>
<p>better woman doesn't breathe--never leave her, Bertha."</p>
<p>"Yah--sure--never--"</p>
<p>Poor Wally. It was as if a wire cage had curved itself somehow about</p>
<p>him, with the egress woven cunningly into the mesh. He was in and</p>
<p>the two women with him, making a prison of what, with either of them</p>
<p>alone, might have been a nest.</p>
<p>Bertha felt, dumbly, fiercely, the relentless pattern of that mesh,</p>
<p>the angry tortured eyes of the three of them looking out. She wanted</p>
<p>to reach and to fold them all to her understanding. Even May.</p>
<p>Constantly, as that winter dragged through, there were half moons in</p>
<p>May's hand where the finger nails bit in.</p>
<p>"She-devil" was an expletive which smoked constantly on her lips.</p>
<p>She said it with her pinkly pointed finger nails cutting up into her</p>
<p>palms and her toes piling and her teeth grating. "She devil."</p>
<p>One day she ran from the luncheon table into the clothes closet in</p>
<p>her bedroom. It was horrible. Because she bit at the empty sleeves</p>
<p>of gowns hanging there, tore fabrics, jerked hangers from their</p>
<p>hooks, trampled on Wally's dressing gown, kicked until she bruised</p>
<p>her shoes and toes against the wall, and finally half collapsed in a</p>
<p>hurricane of the garments she had pulled down about herself. "She</p>
<p>devil. Old Hag. Matzoth face. Can't stand it. Sheenies. Both.</p>
<p>Stingy-gut. She-devil."</p>
<p>It happened trivially. Something like this. About noon a fog had</p>
<p>descended over the city. One of those gray smothers that roll in off</p>
<p>the sea. There was something extremely cozy about the indoors on a</p>
<p>day like this. Bertha prepared tea and fluffed up an egg omelette</p>
<p>with a fusty sense of that warm indoor coziness.</p>
<p>May had been stacking chips for a poker party that night. She was</p>
<p>playing practically every afternoon now, losing large sums which were</p>
<p>the subject of heated controversy with Wally, and five evenings out</p>
<p>of the week there were games at the house, too.</p>
<p>This day she wore a pink flannel wrapper and her hair was in curl</p>
<p>rags that rose off her temples like a shriek. She had a headache,</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>"Got it too good," was the old woman's under-her-breath diagnosis of</p>
<p>the almost daily ritual of cold compress or headache powder.</p>
<p>"Yeh--swell chance for any one to have it good with a tightwad like</p>
<p>you in the house." Also _sotto voce_.</p>
<p>Oftentimes Bertha, hearing, would sicken with a sense of futility</p>
<p>that made almost the lifting of a pan from the stove too nerve</p>
<p>hurting to be endured.</p>
<p>Lunch was a meal to dread with the two women alone, and without the</p>
<p>intermediary influence of Wallenstein.</p>
<p>When May in the pink flannel wrapper entered the fog-swimming dining</p>
<p>room, she switched on the lights, seven high-power ones in the</p>
<p>colored glass dome over the table.</p>
<p>"Give me a tablet in a glass of water first, Bertha. My head's</p>
<p>splitting."</p>
<p>Then old Mrs. Wallenstein came in, stiffly in her black percale house</p>
<p>dress shotted with white four-leaf clovers, and carrying a bowl of</p>
<p>thick black lentil soup which she had warmed from a specially</p>
<p>prepared crock of it which she kept on the window sill.</p>
<p>"Say, May, since when has Wally got a stand-in with the electric</p>
<p>light company? If I can find my mouth in the middle of the day, you</p>
<p>should find yours with your younger eyes."</p>
<p>With a good humor which she valiantly tried to simulate for the trial</p>
<p>of these noonday meals together, the old woman clicked out the lights</p>
<p>again, just as May gulped down the headache tablet. The almost</p>
<p>reflex action of a woman who for a period of thirty thrifty years had</p>
<p>run her own home; and with that same reflex of a woman bound in turn</p>
<p>to run hers, May, the fuzz of fog in a whirlpool of anger about her,</p>
<p>sprang to the wall, clicking the lights back again.</p>
<p>"You dare," she cried with her lips lifting back drily off her teeth,</p>
<p>"you dare to dictate to me when I can have light in my own house and</p>
<p>when I can't!"</p>
<p>The old woman had a way of appearing to shrivel and to yellow under</p>
<p>the lash of her daughter-in-law's tongue. She seemed to recede to a</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>"Is that the way, May, a daughter-in-law should talk to her husband's</p>
<p>mother, nearly three times her age, and who didn't mean nothing but a</p>
<p>little economy?"</p>
<p>"Economy my hind-foot! I'd like to see you or anybody like you tell</p>
<p>me when I can have the electric light on in my house and when I</p>
<p>can't. Not while my dress buttons up the back with tiddlywinks."</p>
<p>"Maybe, May, if you didn't know everything for yourself so well and</p>
<p>would let an old woman three times your age help----"</p>
<p>"Not you. You can't tell me nothing I don't know already."</p>
<p>"I can tell you that a good dutiful wife don't squander her husband's</p>
<p>money away on gambling debts and matinees--"</p>
<p>"You keep your gab out of my affairs. You've done enough damage in</p>
<p>this house as it is. My husband is my business."</p>
<p>"Your husband is my son!"</p>
<p>"More's the pity."</p>
<p>The shuddering, sucky, ligament-twisting cry of the mothers of sons</p>
<p>bearing them. That was the kind of moaning noise Mrs. Wallenstein</p>
<p>made as she went down into a little huddle on a dining-room chair.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wallenstein!"</p>
<p>"Let 'er alone, Bertha. I'm used to those bluffs. I've seen her</p>
<p>topple over into those fake faints for years now. Temper, that's</p>
<p>all. She's tough as tripe."</p>
<p>"Oh God, why don't I die."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wally--she bane old----"</p>
<p>"Let her alone, Bertha, I said. Hands off. That's the trouble now.</p>
<p>Her out there in the kitchen with you all day crying for sympathy.</p>
<p>It's a good thing you're built like a rock-of-ages, with her on your</p>
<p>neck all day or she'd have driven you away long ago, the way she did</p>
<p>every other servant we ever had. I'm sick of it, I am. Wally's got</p>
<p>to decide between her and me and pretty damn quick, too. I wish to</p>
<p>God I could go off somewhere and live in one room and never have to</p>
<p>clap eyes on the whole shebang again. He'll have to settle good and</p>
<p>heavy on me too--mind you that. _Matzoth house_, that's what I call</p>
<p>this. Well, thank God, I wasn't raised no matzoth eater."</p>
<p>"Belittle me. Belittle even my boy ... the finest son a mother ever</p>
<p>could be proud of--but don't make little my religion--don't make</p>
<p>little my God because he is not your God."</p>
<p>"God! Who said anything about your God. Matzoth is what I said, and</p>
<p>I say it again. _Matzoth house_. Two stoves. Two sets of dishes.</p>
<p>Matzoth crumbs all over the house so I have to be ashamed to have</p>
<p>company at my own table for matzoth. Matzoth. He likes 'em</p>
<p>too--dips 'em in coffee. Once a matzoth dunker always a matzoth</p>
<p>dunker. Can't change a leopard's spots. Matzoth is what I said.</p>
<p>You hear! _Matzoth house!_"</p>
<p>"Julius, my husband! Wally, my son! I can't keep it shut up in me</p>
<p>no more. I can't live here no more. To have to see, with every hour</p>
<p>I live, everything what is sacred to me and to mine, made little.</p>
<p>Papa, where are you up there--let me come to you. I'm alone--down</p>
<p>here, and I'm afraid to leave Wally--alone--with no God--help me,</p>
<p>Julius--help----"</p>
<p>May swung heavily into her chair.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, flopping the omelette which was cold by now to her</p>
<p>plate and jabbing into it with her fork, "here is where I am let in</p>
<p>for another pleasant lunch hour. It's a wonder I don't croak of</p>
<p>_kosher_ indigestion."</p>
<p>"I can't hear that word no more so abused! It's like salt in a sore.</p>
<p>Oh--oh--oh--if not for my son, I would right away pack my things--why</p>
<p>did he pull me up away from my people down there--these ways ain't my</p>
<p>ways--those are my people--he should let me go back."</p>
<p>"Well, no insin-uations, but you can take it from me if he didn't</p>
<p>always have you nagging him over to your ways, I could make him a</p>
<p>darn sight happier than he's ever been in his life before. He'd be a</p>
<p>live one, that son of yours--if he dared."</p>
<p>"That just goes to show! A woman with her thoughts on her home and</p>
<p>her husband's interests and--and children--don't got time for such</p>
<p>shennanigan talk like her husband should be a--a live one."</p>
<p>"You're going to ram that children talk down my throat once too</p>
<p>often. I'll have children when I get good and ready to have children</p>
<p>and not before."</p>
<p>"A woman shouldn't put her time for it, before God's time for it."</p>
<p>"If--if you weren't his mother and--old--I'd drive you out of the</p>
<p>house for less than that."</p>
<p>"Why don't you? It would make it easier than I should walk out from</p>
<p>my son's house on my own----"</p>
<p>"Well then--I do! You can't stay here day after day to devil the</p>
<p>life and soul out of me. I won't stand it. I--now--you--go--!"</p>
<p>"God, papa--God--Wally--no--no--it ain't possible I should live to</p>
<p>see it--out from my own son's home----"</p>
<p>"Yes--yes--out of your own son's home--driven out by the devil in</p>
<p>you--yes--yes----"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mrs. Wally--she bane old--oh--oh--oh, Mrs. Wally----"</p>
<p>"And you! Square Head, you! Lummox! There's something about you</p>
<p>gives me the jimjams. For all I know you're one of those still ones</p>
<p>that run deep. How do I know you're not taking sides with the old</p>
<p>woman and running to my husband with lies! Go--the two of you--the</p>
<p>quicker the better--go--go--go--"</p>
<p>It was then, because the words in her throat were a mere strangle and</p>
<p>her hands were curved and spread out like claws, that May ran</p>
<p>screaming to the clothes-closet, dragging down the garments in their</p>
<p>avalanche of fury down about her and gasping, choking, spluttering:</p>
<p>"She devil! Matzoth God! She devil!"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Toward dusk Bertha began to try to feed the old woman soup out of a</p>
<p>spoon that clicked against the square, porcelain teeth that were</p>
<p>twenty years too young for the gums.</p>
<p>"Can't swallow. Leave me alone, Berthie. I'm an old woman put out</p>
<p>from my own son's house. Where shall I go, Berthie? No. No. I</p>
<p>won't go. Nobody can drive me out from my son who needs me and who</p>
<p>has lost his God."</p>
<p>Forcing the spoon against the glassy teeth a sense of the race</p>
<p>indomitability of this old woman smote Bertha. Exactly as she had</p>
<p>recognized the Polish national anthem with her heart, so Bertha knew</p>
<p>this. There was no suppressing the mother of Wallenstein. Oppress</p>
<p>her, yes, but the light of the children of Israel was like a camp</p>
<p>fire in her eyes and would not be ground out.</p>
<p>It was bitter to stay, and the lips of the mother of Wallenstein were</p>
<p>twisted with that bitterness.</p>
<p>"The reason, Berthie, why nothing is so wonderful in a woman's life</p>
<p>as to have children, is because even to suffer for them--to suffer</p>
<p>for them is a blessing."</p>
<p>"To suffer--for--them----"</p>
<p>"But I don't wish it to no woman she should have such a knife in her</p>
<p>heart like mine. Death is not the only way to lose a child. You</p>
<p>should thank God, Berthie, you don't know what it is to give up a son</p>
<p>of your own heart's blood----"</p>
<p>"Not know what it is----"</p>
<p>The brook of the frozen tears, she could feel them thawing and</p>
<p>rushing up against her throat. Bertha who so seldom cried. She</p>
<p>tried to hold them back, tensing her tonsils into a dam against them.</p>
<p>"Take the soup away--Berthie--I can't take it--you're spilling it on</p>
<p>the sheet----"</p>
<p>How they pained, the pressing gorging tears. She was blind with</p>
<p>them, and when she swallowed them down with her great strength, they</p>
<p>ran back upon themselves and filled her with hurting torrents.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, Mrs. Wallenstein," she said finally, the words coming out</p>
<p>evenly over her own inner hemorrhage of tears.</p>
<p>"Two babies I lost to death, Berthie--but not even such suffering was</p>
<p>so bad as to lose a child to life."</p>
<p>"To--_give_--a--child--to--life, Mrs. Wallenstein."</p>
<p>"Hold me, Berthie, close--and say that over to me--over and over</p>
<p>again--to _give_--and not to lose--him----."</p>
<p>"To--give--a--child--to--life. To--give--a--child--to--life.</p>
<p>To--give----."</p>
<p>The old woman slept and finally there was dinner to be prepared and</p>
<p>it was Bertha's day for scrubbing the kitchen floor on her hands and</p>
<p>knees.</p>
<p>It was good, the great harsh drags across the splintery boards, pools</p>
<p>of soapy water smearing before the brush, her shoulders sweating.</p>
<p>Good, good, to sprawl for that reach under the sink, with her great</p>
<p>legs thrown out like those of a swimming frog's, and her heart</p>
<p>through the soft pad of breasts, beating down close where the tremors</p>
<p>were. The little vibratory tremors....</p>
<p>Great soapy circles. Pain that had dimension--pain the shape of her</p>
<p>arm sockets. Singing knees and the pleasant relief of lifting one</p>
<p>from the floor so that the sensation died down like suds.</p>
<p>Zeouw! Zeouw! This way and that, the water running a little after</p>
<p>the brush, and the smell that was almost a green one, coming up</p>
<p>between the boards. Water under her brush. She ground it in and in</p>
<p>and in, back into the soil from whence at some time or another it had</p>
<p>come and from whence it would come again.</p>
<p>At seven Wallenstein would come. There was dinner to be prepared. A</p>
<p>round of roast the shape of a cord of kindling wood. Gristle ran</p>
<p>through it. She cut it out as if it had been a nerve. A nasty</p>
<p>hurting thing. It was good to be able to slither it out and throw it</p>
<p>away in the tin pail under the sink.</p>
<p>Onions to peel. Tears. Light tears that seemed to leap from the</p>
<p>outside and lay against the eyes. Not the inner pushing ones that</p>
<p>tore the throat in their frenzy to get past. The smart ran up to her</p>
<p>nostrils. Good. Good. She could rub her nose, thick, white and</p>
<p>squatting and lawk, the smart was gone. Easy pain. The pull of her</p>
<p>arm sockets. Easy pain. But to be able to tear open her</p>
<p>throat--somehow--and get in at the torment there--the buried secret</p>
<p>torments that had not dimension....</p>
<p>Wallenstein would be home any minute now. Bertha had a sly little</p>
<p>procedure before dinner. It was to draw together two of the most</p>
<p>comfortable chairs in the living room, chummily, as if two women had</p>
<p>been sewing and gossiping there during the long quiet of an</p>
<p>afternoon. And Wallenstein liked the little first-hand attentions</p>
<p>that May, in prime mood, would give him. His slippers with the toes</p>
<p>out, standing waiting. A glass of orange juice on the table beside</p>
<p>their bed.</p>
<p>The look of strain and of drain would run out of his face when he</p>
<p>walked in on evidences of what might indicate that a day of rare</p>
<p>tranquillity had rolled over the household. He was quick at these</p>
<p>perceptions. An overturned hassock might mean that May's toe had</p>
<p>been stubbed in rage, or the sweetish thickness of an incense stick,</p>
<p>burning up into garlic fumes, warn of conflict before he had even</p>
<p>fitted his key into the lock.</p>
<p>Bertha was particularly careful about the two chairs. She dragged</p>
<p>them together and they squealed on their casters. They met his eye</p>
<p>directly he entered. May was stretched asleep on the sitting room</p>
<p>couch, her cheeks still wet and her lips, always with the sensuous</p>
<p>look of just having been kissed very hard, slightly, rather</p>
<p>appealingly, apart. One of her hands trailed to the floor and there</p>
<p>was a pale scatter of freckles on her arm, great isolated ones, so</p>
<p>large and far apart that Wallenstein could run his lips up it as if</p>
<p>it were a flute, kissing them one by one.</p>
<p>But when he finally did turn his key in the lock, it was as if May,</p>
<p>deeply simulating sleep, had been merely lying on the edge of it</p>
<p>waiting, so quickly she pounced at him, the castle of her yellow</p>
<p>puffs down over one ear and her right eye dragged upward from lying</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>"May! My dear----"</p>
<p>"Yah, 'dear'--you'd better 'dear' me--leaving me shut up here day</p>
<p>after day with a lunatic. Well, you don't need to go no further to</p>
<p>hear her side of the story with her lies, lies, lies! You can hear</p>
<p>it right here from me. Either that old woman gets out of this</p>
<p>house--here--now--to-night--or I go! As God is my witness--I'm</p>
<p>through!"</p>
<p>All the little wrinkles came running into his face like sand over</p>
<p>paper and he tried to take her in his arms.</p>
<p>"Oh no, you don't! Not this time. A few smooth words can't make up</p>
<p>for the all-day hell of living in this house. That old woman goes or</p>
<p>I go! I couldn't stand another day of it. You've been a long time</p>
<p>choosing, but you've got to chose now! I've tried. I've bit my</p>
<p>tongue in two trying. But I'm done."</p>
<p>"Why, May," he said in the sedative tone that must have worn a little</p>
<p>rut along his vocal cords from the repetition of it. "I know that</p>
<p>Ma's not easy, and there's not a day that I don't think of my girl at</p>
<p>home under conditions that aren't just right for her, but she's old,</p>
<p>May, and she means well and--and good God, May, a man's mother is a</p>
<p>man's mother, little eccentricities and all."</p>
<p>"No--no--we ain't going to argue any more, not while my dress buttons</p>
<p>up the back with tiddlywinks. I've been over it all till I'm as</p>
<p>crazy loony as she is. You got to decide. This time it's me or her.</p>
<p>One of us gets out!"</p>
<p>His nose was like a blade, the nostrils sort of drawn in by the</p>
<p>sharpness of his breath, and he stood under the hall light, growing</p>
<p>paler and paler as the fatigue lines deepened.</p>
<p>"May! you've never been like this! Has anything unusual happened?</p>
<p>My mother--how--where is she?"</p>
<p>"Oh no! Nothing unusual. Just the usual. That's the devil of it!</p>
<p>Just the usual, but the camel's back broke to-day. There's no</p>
<p>argument. There's just for you to decide which of us gets out." Her</p>
<p>body was bent backward in a curve and her head dangling, as if it</p>
<p>were a pale lantern weighing down the bamboo pole of her body.</p>
<p>He looked at her and at the shine of her flesh up at him through the</p>
<p>lace of her bodice and the old familiar trembling seized him, but he</p>
<p>dug with his nails into his palms and his words were all crowded</p>
<p>behind his teeth.</p>
<p>"Well then by God--you go!"</p>
<p>It was as if he had stabbed her in the up-thrust of bosom she could</p>
<p>always dazzle him with, because she threw out her arms and stood like</p>
<p>a great open fan, with the finery of her sleeve drapes falling to the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>"Me!"</p>
<p>"You," he said, "yes--yes--you----"</p>
<p>"You don't mean that--Wally."</p>
<p>"I do," he said, still with the jam of words behind his teeth.</p>
<p>For the first time her body sort of unwound itself of its tight</p>
<p>theatricalism and she looked at him with her mouth shaped to cry out,</p>
<p>but it only quivered.</p>
<p>"If anybody goes out of this house, it's not going to be my mother.</p>
<p>Get that! I may be low--but not that low. She stays here!"</p>
<p>"You heard what I got to say," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I heard," he said, and looked at her steadily and without the</p>
<p>flicker of a muscle. "I heard."</p>
<p>There was a pause that was full of their breathing and then with a</p>
<p>lightning gesture she darted out for his hand, but he was too quick</p>
<p>for her.</p>
<p>"Wally!"</p>
<p>"No," he said, holding it behind him, "no, none of that."</p>
<p>She darted again and he looked at her coldly and smiled, holding</p>
<p>himself on a little oblique that eluded her.</p>
<p>"That don't go this time, May. I'm at the end of my rope here. You</p>
<p>have been called upon to make certain sacrifices. I know that. And</p>
<p>I don't say they have always been easy ones. But that's part of this</p>
<p>game of marriage. Learning to take the hurdles. You haven't taken</p>
<p>yours. There's no argument here. Between two women, one of them</p>
<p>young and able to take care of herself, and the other seventy years</p>
<p>old and--my mother--well, if it's a case of one of them having to go,</p>
<p>it's not going to be my mother! This is one of those deadlocks in</p>
<p>marriage where there is no solution. A woman either gives in or</p>
<p>she--don't. You don't!"</p>
<p>With his body thrust back from her, the words in her mouth were meal,</p>
<p>and she knew it and suddenly, with a sinuosity that was rare with</p>
<p>her, she had her arms about his knees and her cheek to him and her</p>
<p>sobs coming, so that even through the fabric of suiting her warm</p>
<p>breath reached him.</p>
<p>"Wally!"</p>
<p>He wrenched himself, but the vise of her arms was relentless, and so</p>
<p>with his head held up and his body still tense he stood taut, feeling</p>
<p>the tremor of her and finally the wet of her</p>
<p>tears--warm--warm--against his knee.</p>
<p>"Get up," he said, with his head back and his body away from her.</p>
<p>"Wally--Wally--for God's sake don't--don't throw me off for</p>
<p>her--Wally----."</p>
<p>"Off! Good God, what's a man to do--murder an old woman to get her</p>
<p>out of the way of a young one--God--God--what mess have I let myself</p>
<p>into! God--God--May--don't----."</p>
<p>"Wally"--her hands were up now against his waistcoat, so that the</p>
<p>shape of them burned through, and his face, which he kept averted,</p>
<p>was reddening, a slow red that ran down into his collar.</p>
<p>"You can't get me that--way--any--more----" he said, and caught her</p>
<p>two hands by the wrists and flung her backward, but she was too quick</p>
<p>for him again, and, as if from the momentum of the shove, she was</p>
<p>back again, with her arms about his neck, and her lips which were</p>
<p>shining with tears, straight and pat against his.</p>
<p>"No--No--May--none of that--no--I say--oh----"</p>
<p>Suddenly it was quiet, and when he lifted his head she was crouched</p>
<p>in a cradle his arms made for her and the tears were running heavily</p>
<p>down his cheeks.</p>
<p>"I'm tired," he said, crying frankly and daubing his eyes with the</p>
<p>back of her hand, "--dog tired" and sank down on a chair in the</p>
<p>hallway and she dragged up a stool, an outlandish one on the four</p>
<p>curved horns of a bull, and her arms were about his knees again and</p>
<p>her shining lips always close enough for him to feel the breath.</p>
<p>"You love me, Wally--I love you--what's the use--you can't give me</p>
<p>up----"</p>
<p>He beat his knees.</p>
<p>"God. God. Was ever a man in my plight? I can't give you up.</p>
<p>Well, where does that get me? I can't give her up, and the two of</p>
<p>you together are making my home a hell. I'm cursed _with_ you and</p>
<p>I'm cursed without you. God, God, was ever a man in such hell? I'll</p>
<p>be the one to get out--by God--I'll end it--I'll be the one to get</p>
<p>out----"</p>
<p>"Wally--Wally, that won't solve anything. That will bust it up for</p>
<p>all three. I've got a way out for us. Wally, it's the old woman. I</p>
<p>tell you she--she's got to go!"</p>
<p>"And, by God, I tell you, no! My mother doesn't pine out her days</p>
<p>alone in a rooming house----"</p>
<p>"No--no, Wally, you don't understand. Why I--you think I'd let her</p>
<p>pine out her days in a rooming house? The old woman's sick, Wally.</p>
<p>Her mind's sick. The old woman needs a hospital--a fine sunny big</p>
<p>hospital where they can take care of her----"</p>
<p>"My mother's not sick--she's--she's old--she's orthodox and she</p>
<p>believes so strong it makes her eccentric--she's not sick---."</p>
<p>"She is, Wally. Any doctor would say so. You don't see her all day</p>
<p>in the house like I do. You're making me live with a lunatic, Wally."</p>
<p>"You--take that back!"</p>
<p>"You don't know it. But I do. She sits all day talking to herself.</p>
<p>I'm afraid of her. I wouldn't ask you to throw her out, Wally. I'm</p>
<p>telling you she's got screws loose. She can get violent any time and</p>
<p>then you will have trouble. There's institutions. Fine sunny clean</p>
<p>ones. She ought to be committed. It's the only way, Wally---to save</p>
<p>her--and to save us. You want us to go to hell over a--a loon? Lots</p>
<p>of people go crazy on religion--the old woman, Wally--has screws</p>
<p>loose--it's against the law not to give her medical</p>
<p>treatment--there's plenty places, Wally--fine clean places where they</p>
<p>don't even know they're in that kind of a place where she can live in</p>
<p>peace and we can stay here in peace. Wally, are you going to throw</p>
<p>me over for a poor old woman that's lost her mind? I tell you she's</p>
<p>crazy, Wally. What'll you have out of it if I get out and leave you</p>
<p>here with a loon? You got to support me. No man can get away</p>
<p>without doing his duty to me. You got her and you got me any way you</p>
<p>look at it. If one of us got to go, the poor crazy old lady ought to</p>
<p>be the one. Get her in a--an--asy--a--hospital, Wally--and that'll</p>
<p>leave us here--in our home--together. Wally--poor, tired Wally--home</p>
<p>alone--here with his May."</p>
<p>His head fell down against the little cove of her shoulder and he</p>
<p>could feel her warm kisses through his hair, and finally when he</p>
<p>looked up with the stricken eyes of a St. Bernard dog, the tears ran</p>
<p>down over his words.</p>
<p>"I can't give you up, May. My poor mother--she's sick--she needs the</p>
<p>best of care--best--institution--she's sick--and she's</p>
<p>got--to--go----"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Tears. Tears. The dining room looked crazy through the blur of</p>
<p>them, and setting out the salt cellars and the vinegar cruet Bertha</p>
<p>could scarcely find the table. It waved up at her, Tilted. Ran in</p>
<p>little ripples that the tears made. Tears. Tears, The old woman----</p>
<p>She ran down the hall. It shot off in a little ell and on the slant</p>
<p>of wall was the door. The door that was between the old woman and</p>
<p>the knowing. The bitter knowing that must presently creep toward it</p>
<p>and under it like a terrible tide. She crashed through the door and</p>
<p>stood trembling in the center of the room.</p>
<p>The night light was burning and the old woman flew up in her vast</p>
<p>walnut bed with a cry.</p>
<p>"Wally--who? Ach, Berthie, how you frightened me. I must have been</p>
<p>dreaming. My Wally. My Julius--Berthie--it ain't nice you should</p>
<p>rush in so on me. You've made me a pain--here. What is it,</p>
<p>Berthie--nothing ain't wrong--Wally--home yet? Nothing ain't wrong?"</p>
<p>"Why--no--Mrs. Wallenstein--nothing--I yoost looked in a</p>
<p>minute--maybe you want something?"</p>
<p>"No--I--Berthie--you shouldn't rush in so--a pain here--from the</p>
<p>fright you gave me--such a pain--my heart--ach no--Berthie--I can't</p>
<p>lay down--it's a knife in me--you frightened me so--my heart----"</p>
<p>Her face was so little, and back in the frill of her cap a pointed</p>
<p>sort of receding look had set in, and she writhed up from the support</p>
<p>of Bertha's arm, against the pain of lying back on the pillows.</p>
<p>"My drops--quick, Berthie--my drops. I--you shouldn't have</p>
<p>frightened me--quick--my drops from the doctor."</p>
<p>There they stood, the little colorless phial of them on the table</p>
<p>beside the bed. Five of them. Bertha knew</p>
<p>how--drop-drop-drop-drop-drop--into a tumbler.</p>
<p>"Berthie--please----"</p>
<p>"No, Mrs. Wallenstein--no--yoost--lay still---- No, not any drops</p>
<p>this time--sleep--sh-h-h--no drops--sleep."</p>
<p>"I--my drops--pain--I--I'm so tired, Berthie--hold me--you frightened</p>
<p>me so--I was dreaming--my boy--she didn't get him--away from me--she</p>
<p>tried, Berthie--I dreamed--but she didn't--he wouldn't--my boy--he</p>
<p>stuck to his mama--she's old--she's in the way--but he stuck--why</p>
<p>don't you give me my drops, Berthie? I--he stuck by his mama,</p>
<p>Berthie----"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Wallenstein--he stuck----"</p>
<p>"I--I was never so tired--my drops--you should give me my</p>
<p>drops--dark--Berthie--yes, Julius--tired--he stuck--my boy--to his</p>
<p>mama--didn't he, Berthie?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Wallenstein--yes----"</p>
<p>"--tired--my--drops. Wally--oh--God--ouch--oh--oh--ah----"</p>
<p>A sudden lurch forward in Bertha's arms, so that her torso rounded up</p>
<p>and left an arch of space between it and the bed.</p>
<p>It was hard to unbend it, because the body had stiffened, and with</p>
<p>her cheek to Mrs. Wallenstein's heart, Bertha pressed, pressed gently</p>
<p>until the little attitude of convulsion had straightened. It was so</p>
<p>quiet there with her cheek to Mrs. Wallenstein's dead heart.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A doctor folded the brittle hands. Little gulls skimming the old</p>
<p>breast. The preliminaries of death were set in motion. A soul had</p>
<p>been set free and mortals were solemn. Almost immediately the shades</p>
<p>somehow were down and there was a new odor. The odor of death.</p>
<p>May had gone out like a flame. Her face seemed suddenly very small</p>
<p>between the two enormous blobs of pearl earrings, and she had pinned</p>
<p>up the flowing sleeves so that she had the plucked, necky look of a</p>
<p>fine bird that had lost its feathers, revealing the long pores of</p>
<p>dingy flesh.</p>
<p>"Poor Wally. Poor Wally."</p>
<p>He looked at her through tear-scalded eyes that did not see her at</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>"My mother--my poor little mother--gone without a word----"</p>
<p>"Lots of them go that way, Wally. My old woman died in her sleep----"</p>
<p>"God--God, what her poor little life must have been here alone in</p>
<p>this room--nights. Mama forgive me. Mama, forgive me."</p>
<p>"She was a good sleeper, Wally. I used to hear her snoring and</p>
<p>always tiptoe by the door. I was always careful not to wake her."</p>
<p>May, craven with death.</p>
<p>He looked at her with his eyes full up with misery, and kept</p>
<p>repeating over and over again his phrases--"Mama forgive me. Poor</p>
<p>little life. I knew what you suffered, mama. There wasn't an hour</p>
<p>of the day or night it wasn't over me. I did it. I did it. Mama,</p>
<p>mama forgive--why did you leave me----?"</p>
<p>"Wally, you've got your May. Poor, poor Wally, don't cry--ain't you</p>
<p>got your May?"</p>
<p>He kissed her wildly, his wet lips smearing over her cheeks and the</p>
<p>twisted, crazy look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Help me--help me to bear my remorse. I used to snap her off. I</p>
<p>never had patience with her. We left her alone when we went to the</p>
<p>country--alone here--she might have died like a dog--she did die</p>
<p>alone--like a dog--alone----"</p>
<p>"No, Wally. No. Bertha was with her!"</p>
<p>"Bertha! Then why didn't she give my mother her drops? She let her</p>
<p>die like a dog. That's what the doctor asked--why didn't the person</p>
<p>in whose arms she died, give her the drops? Murderer--where is</p>
<p>she--get out--where is she--I want her to get out!"</p>
<p>And Bertha, carrying down through the gloom of the hallway the seven</p>
<p>branch candlestick for the foot of old lady Wallenstein's bed, stood</p>
<p>hearing, her face picked out in light above the pointing flames. A</p>
<p>white face, floating in shadow and shining out of the darkness that</p>
<p>poured around it.</p>
<p>A clear, prophetic face above the seven lights.</p>
<p>It was then, gazing upon her, that Wally turned on his wife and</p>
<p>struck her three times on the very cheek that his lips had smeared.</p>
<p>"Mama," he screamed, "forgive me," and smoking hot off his lips came</p>
<p>words that had long since lain dead like dried roseleaves in his</p>
<p>memory.</p>
<p>[Illustration: Hebrew text]</p>
<p>Then he turned around on May.</p>
<p>"You go," he said, with his fingers curling inward to form little</p>
<p>cages, "go--go--while God gives me strength not to kill you. My</p>
<p>mama--my God--my darling, heartbroken mama--you made me a traitor to</p>
<p>her--you--you--you! Go--go--or so help me God--if ever I see you</p>
<p>again--God strike me dead if I don't kill you."</p>
<p>"Wally--for God's sake--don't--don't! Let me loose. I'll go, Wally.</p>
<p>Leave me go, Wally--for God's sake. You hurt! I'll go--Wally."</p>
<p>After a while it was quiet in the house. There was still the little</p>
<p>frangipani scent of May in her room, where she had fussed about in</p>
<p>the hysteria of packing. It followed her trail along the hallway as</p>
<p>she backed down it in terror, her little valise, with a twist of lace</p>
<p>caught in the fastening, held out before her. Then the hall</p>
<p>door--and out.</p>
<p>Quiet. With the light from the seven candles burning against the</p>
<p>transom and out palely into the hall, and Wally silent in there hour</p>
<p>after hour, cramped up against the bedside of his dead.</p>
<p>At midnight the first Mourner sprang up. One of the Old Testament</p>
<p>women off the stoop in Division Street, and from behind the closed</p>
<p>door, when she slid in beside Wally, her cry went down like a rapier</p>
<p>into the heart of the silence. A cry that stuck there to the hilt.</p>
<p>Toward morning when the Mourner dozed in a rocker at the foot of the</p>
<p>old woman's bed, Wally, who had never moved from his crouch at the</p>
<p>headboard, sprang up suddenly, his hair torn down over his face, but</p>
<p>his eyes clear.</p>
<p>"Bertha," he called, and ran out to the hallway and into her room.</p>
<p>"Bertha--you--you knew! Bertha--you cook!</p>
<p>Bertha--Bertha--come--back--Bertha--I see it now--Bertha----"</p>
<p>At that moment, in a dawn that ran thinly along the edge of the</p>
<p>roofs, Bertha with her carpetbag hooked to her fingers was walking.</p>
<p>East. A wettish wind, the wind before the dawn, blew her all</p>
<p>forward. Her skirts. Some strands of her paling yellow hair and the</p>
<p>terribly dilapidated old rose on her hat.</p>
<p>There were no pedestrians. Not even milk carts yet. Only Bertha,</p>
<p>walking before the wind.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Annie Wennerberg was on her back. Tied in a knot there on a cot of a</p>
<p>rheumatism that made bulbs of her knuckles, and swelled up her legs</p>
<p>as if they had been great goatskin water bags.</p>
<p>It was horrid, coming out of the clear morning, to walk in on her,</p>
<p>tucked way back in the lurking room she shared with the Australian</p>
<p>sailor when he was in port.</p>
<p>An iron shutter from the warehouse next door blocked the window, so</p>
<p>that it was dark and the jet of gas burned in there all day and kept</p>
<p>the smells warm. A sickening, stinking room, with Annie knotted into</p>
<p>it as fast to its walls as a fungus.</p>
<p>And Annie in all her knots of pain, looked fat--a swollen fat that</p>
<p>was the color of the goatskin water bags.</p>
<p>There were several pillows in their dingy tickings stacked behind</p>
<p>Annie's back, and a gray blanket wrapped around her legs that were as</p>
<p>lifeless looking as an old bundle. Jocko slept up against them.</p>
<p>A child of about fourteen, with a three-cornered face and a</p>
<p>three-cornered shawl spanning her little shoulders that were held in</p>
<p>as if from the shivers, was spreading a thick paste along a bit of</p>
<p>cloth. Antiphlogistine.</p>
<p>Bertha knew. The poultices like those she had made for Annie when</p>
<p>she herself was a child! And the cry that met Bertha as she entered.</p>
<p>She knew that, too. A whinny.</p>
<p>"I'm sick as a dog--lying here nine weeks come next Monday. My</p>
<p>joints won't untie. Nobody to do a turn. You're a lunk or you'd</p>
<p>look in on a body year in and year out. Me that raised you and fed</p>
<p>you when your tongue might have been hanging out for want of a home.</p>
<p>Clean me up--Bertha. There's eight cots upstairs walking away with</p>
<p>themselves, and only this brat doing the work of 'em. There's a</p>
<p>fruit freighter of boys in to-morrow--clean me up--Bertha."</p>
<p>And so that morning, with her carpetbag and coat on a chair in the</p>
<p>kitchen, Bertha moved Annie out of the hot, unaired nest of her</p>
<p>blanket, rubbed her with a liniment the doctor from the clinic had</p>
<p>left, combed out the gray dribble of hair, and got her back somehow</p>
<p>into the knot that was easiest for her to lie in. Poor Annie cried</p>
<p>out at Bertha lifting her ever so gently from her huddle, and the</p>
<p>little girl's shoulders shivered narrower together, and Jocko let</p>
<p>himself be dragged along with the blanket sooner than uncurl out of</p>
<p>his warmth. Annie wanted gin terribly and screamed for it. Its acid</p>
<p>was what was burning in her joints, but at noon she finally fell</p>
<p>asleep, shuddering and groaning. That afternoon, on her hands and</p>
<p>knees, Bertha washed down two of the dirty flights of stairs, did the</p>
<p>unmentionable chores of slops and bedding, turned over a drunken</p>
<p>sailor on his cot, and washed open his grit-bound eyes.</p>
<p>For eleven months, while Annie slowly untwisted and the swelling went</p>
<p>down, Bertha scrubbed these floors, tended the twenty cots, and</p>
<p>helped countless drunken sailors to bed by pulling off their heavy</p>
<p>shoes and piling them, like great lolling sacks of potatoes,</p>
<p>underneath the thin gray blankets, sometimes hoisting them upstairs</p>
<p>by the armpits, with an occasional boost of her knee from the rear.</p>
<p>One boy died up there one night of delirium tremens. No one could</p>
<p>get hold of his arms to twist them behind him. Bertha did finally,</p>
<p>squatting on his head as if he were a fallen horse, while a sailor</p>
<p>sat on his feet and still another on his middle. He was a</p>
<p>Scandinavian with a thin blond beard and a neck as lovely as a</p>
<p>woman's. With his wrists tied together he lay back in Bertha's arms.</p>
<p>She held him across her lap, he kicking and plunging his shoulders</p>
<p>this way and that. It was horrible to feel his great body fling back</p>
<p>against her knees and the strange foreign words flying on flecks of</p>
<p>foam from his lips. She began to croon to him one of the Polish</p>
<p>melodies that she knew somehow with her heart. He turned his eyes to</p>
<p>her, and watching the little beating movement her throat made as she</p>
<p>sat singing there in the dirty gas light, began to grow quiet. She</p>
<p>unloosed his hands. Finally, when the ambulance came he was asleep,</p>
<p>with his cheek to her heart and one arm about her neck, like a child.</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>Months of these fantastic, sailor-infested nights. Night after night</p>
<p>of brawl after brawl. The slapping of hands against the walls of the</p>
<p>narrow hallways from the lurching this way and that. Little yellow</p>
<p>seamen with eyes that could seem to hang in the darkness of those</p>
<p>halls long after they had passed through it. Slant gashes. The</p>
<p>squawks and cries of men bestial in their sleep or dreaming of thirst</p>
<p>and typhoon, mutiny and sudden death.</p>
<p>The lowing of steamers. Enormous cries, as if a strange breed of sea</p>
<p>cattle were swimming in with the tide.</p>
<p>Wide, impersonal nights that the sense of the nearness of the sea</p>
<p>could make seem vast and booming. And all these little men of every</p>
<p>clime groping in its enormous darkness, dreaming their puny bestial</p>
<p>dreams into it, cowing away from the stars, most of them, on their</p>
<p>bellies up there on Annie's cots, their lids granulated and their</p>
<p>breathing sour.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Chita, the little slavey, came every day. She was one of fourteen</p>
<p>children in a Minetta Lane tenement and she was as wiry as Jocko and</p>
<p>as quick upstairs and down. She never ran her errands but rode her</p>
<p>way, curled up in a little cocoon on the back of a truck and dodging</p>
<p>the driver's each crack of the whip. She could sidestep a blow from</p>
<p>Annie with one beautiful curve of her little body, and once she ran</p>
<p>up Bertha's great flank, for all the world like Jocko, and turned a</p>
<p>double somersault down off her shoulder.</p>
<p>In winter her hands bled from chapping and her little nose was horrid</p>
<p>and her eyes grew into great disks as her face became smaller under</p>
<p>the pinch of cold.</p>
<p>Bertha bought her a reefer and mittens at the Sailors' Supply Store</p>
<p>and hemmed her two muslin handkerchiefs, which she bunched into dirty</p>
<p>little wads, and immediately lost.</p>
<p>She was as incessant as a buzz. Quick, capering, noiseless on her</p>
<p>feet. Never actually ill, but always with the head colds and her</p>
<p>little arms so skinny that it hurt to see them strain to lift a pail.</p>
<p>This was little Chita who came, as that slow damp winter wore on, to</p>
<p>live in the big, dim shadow of Bertha. She was fourteen and Bertha,</p>
<p>who knew what the sailors could say in their bestial dreams, kept her</p>
<p>close.</p>
<p>It was not a cold year, only sullen and penetrating and full of soot.</p>
<p>Bertha and Chita were covered with it. It blew in on the plumes of</p>
<p>smoke off the harbor tugs. The furnace belched it out at them.</p>
<p>Chita's little face was like a feeble light behind her mask of this</p>
<p>soot and, looking in a straight line down her own nose, Bertha could</p>
<p>see the black marks, smeared along the flesh.</p>
<p>Sometimes the sailors sent Chita out for stogies or tobacco or beer.</p>
<p>She was greedy of the pennies and foreign coins they threw, sometimes</p>
<p>sucking them up under her tongue all day and holding her mouth grim</p>
<p>and tight when Bertha tried to pry in a finger to force them out.</p>
<p>A long winter that, more like a cloudy November dusk. Annie knotted</p>
<p>into her bed and looking out through the door of her room, which she</p>
<p>always kept open, upon the two of them moving so tirelessly upstairs</p>
<p>and down, at slops, scrubbing until the wet stench rose, and when a</p>
<p>fruit steamer or a freighter came in, running with the gray blankets</p>
<p>and the pillows.</p>
<p>Chita feared Annie and the vituperative words. She seemed to shrink</p>
<p>and the disks of her eyes to become larger. Annie's hands were too</p>
<p>crippled to strike her, but all the same she would quiver back, her</p>
<p>arm dodging up before her eyes, and the great bony bulbs of her knees</p>
<p>clicking together.</p>
<p>But in the shadow of Bertha it was safe. There she could play around</p>
<p>with Jocko, herself so curiously like Jocko, cheating on the job</p>
<p>outrageously. They would start, she and Bertha, at the opposite ends</p>
<p>of a floor, scrubbing toward the center, only Chita never arrived.</p>
<p>She liked to sit in a huddle and rock herself, arms locked about her</p>
<p>ankles and chitter--chitter questions at the great crawling hulk of</p>
<p>Bertha as she came scrubbing toward her on all fours, her arm</p>
<p>plunging from the socket and sweeping its great circle of dirty suds.</p>
<p>Darting, steely little questions that she threw like knives in</p>
<p>mumblety-peg, landing them straight up.</p>
<p>"Bertha, b'Jesus-- Whozee? Huh?"</p>
<p>"Jesus? He was a man, Chita."</p>
<p>"A man nawthin'! He's God."</p>
<p>"He bane a perfect man."</p>
<p>"Bloke, you! God wusn't a man. God, he had curls and a white dress."</p>
<p>"Yah--He--was drenched in Light--that was his white dress."</p>
<p>"Bloke, you! Light ain't no white dress. Silk is. That's you!"</p>
<p>said Chita and slid out with her palm a splash of greasy water from</p>
<p>her scrub pail upon Bertha--"that's you--drenched in slop."</p>
<p>Bertha boxed her then, roundly against the ear, so that the little</p>
<p>imp, strung on her wires of legs, jumped and dangled.</p>
<p>"You bane a--a bad rowdy--brat--."</p>
<p>"Bertha--drenched in--slop--."</p>
<p>She looked down to fleck off some webby stuff that had clung to her</p>
<p>gray woolen skirt.</p>
<p>"Slop cannot drench--like Light!"</p>
<p>"What light?"</p>
<p>"His!"</p>
<p>"Aw you--square head--there ain't no light."</p>
<p>"Aw you--curly head, there ain't unless you see it."</p>
<p>Sometimes Bertha kissed her, right down into the riot of short curls</p>
<p>that rose off her head like the suds of a shampoo.</p>
<p>But Chita was nervous and vicious from being afraid. Once she bit</p>
<p>Bertha on the lips until they bled.</p>
<p>"Bloke, you fooled me--diden you? Bloke you! I thought you wuz</p>
<p>gonna hit."</p>
<p>Chita had black and blue marks on her arms and down her lean little</p>
<p>legs. Usually when she came to work in the morning she could display</p>
<p>new ones. Not without pride.</p>
<p>"Me mudder give me this one. Me old man. Me brud! Look at 'em and</p>
<p>make a snoot, Bertha."</p>
<p>The sight of these blue and green bruises, burning there so sullenly</p>
<p>along the tan little limbs of Chita, could cause Bertha's lips to</p>
<p>fold back in a quivering ejaculation of sickness. That was a "snoot."</p>
<p>"I don't know any snoots, Chita."</p>
<p>"There, bloke you--you're doing one now--a snoot like there was</p>
<p>somebody sticking a knife and fork in you and then cutting you up in</p>
<p>little bittsa pieces----"</p>
<p>Chita was fond of the torturous phrase. She liked to devise them.</p>
<p>Her father's favorite threat to her was, "I'll brekka your leg."</p>
<p>"Bertha, what if somebody 'ud cut off Annie Wennerberg's head and</p>
<p>cook it with cabbage."</p>
<p>"Chita, you think only bad thoughts."</p>
<p>"Me brud stuck a pin in my wrist once, all the way in."</p>
<p>"Poor Chita."</p>
<p>"If I was a jackknife I'd cut all bad people's eyes out----"</p>
<p>"Poor Chita--it bane terrible bad for you with your people----"</p>
<p>"I'd slit a Chinaman if I had a butcher knife."</p>
<p>"Chita!"</p>
<p>"Looka, he gimme this--me old man--he pinched--look--make a snoot</p>
<p>now--look--ouch--don't touch."</p>
<p>It was a savage-looking black and blue mark on her shoulder, and one</p>
<p>day it began to fester and Chita, a little stoic for pain, started</p>
<p>whimpering and reaching up her lower lip to suck in the tears.</p>
<p>Squatting in their puddles, as they scrubbed toward one another down</p>
<p>one of the pitch-black upper halls, Bertha, who had grown bold in</p>
<p>words with this child, began to piece out a story to soothe her.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, Chita."</p>
<p>"Hurts. Hurts."</p>
<p>"Poor little Chita your tears are falling right in the</p>
<p>scrub-bucket----"</p>
<p>"I hurt so, Bertha----"</p>
<p>"Sh-h, don't cry, Chita. Once upon a time, there was a good little</p>
<p>girl like you----"</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"Yah. She cried too, little Chita, because her wounds they hurt."</p>
<p>"Pinches, like mine."</p>
<p>"Yah, pinches."</p>
<p>"An' bloody sores--I got bloody sores, too----"</p>
<p>"And bloody sores----"</p>
<p>"And she lived by the ocean----"</p>
<p>"The Cunard piers?"</p>
<p>"No--no--out somewhere--old countree--a gray ocean--with rocks----"</p>
<p>"Old countree. Naples is old countree----"</p>
<p>"It was lonely by the ocean. Sometimes she cried much."</p>
<p>"No mudder--no brud?"</p>
<p>"Nobody. Only wind that tore her and rain that wet her and snow that</p>
<p>froze her."</p>
<p>"No bread? No spagett'?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes a fisherman out of a boat on the sea brought her fish----"</p>
<p>"A beau----"</p>
<p>"N-no--yoost--a man."</p>
<p>"Did he like 'er?"</p>
<p>"She--could--clean--fish----"</p>
<p>"Ugh!"</p>
<p>"But that was yoost ugly to her hands and she did not mind."</p>
<p>"Phew!"</p>
<p>"She used to cry--sometimes because it was so beautiful--the rocks</p>
<p>and the sea--or so lonely--the sky and the rocks and the sea--so</p>
<p>big--like she felt inside of-herself--big----"</p>
<p>"Big as--New York?"</p>
<p>"Yah--she used to cry--right out of her heart--into the waves--yoost</p>
<p>like you cry into the bucket--and whadda you think?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Her tears got folded up in the water of the waves and one day a</p>
<p>little girl way off in New York----"</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"Yah--took a drink of water and whadda you think was in the drink of</p>
<p>water?"</p>
<p>"A bug!"</p>
<p>"The tears--the beautiful tears that the lonely girl in old countree</p>
<p>had cried because the sea was so lonely and the sky and the rocks and</p>
<p>the sea--so big and--and heart-breaking and----"</p>
<p>"She drank 'em--the same tears----"</p>
<p>"Yah--and whadda you think?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"When she drank 'em--the little girl off in New York----"</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"Yah--they began to boil inside of her----"</p>
<p>"How----"</p>
<p>"Just boil--and swell--like waves--and she was all full--of the sky</p>
<p>and rocks and the sea and the heart-break and whadda you think?"</p>
<p>"What? She busted!"</p>
<p>"She began to sing, Chit--the tears inside they were hurting--and she</p>
<p>began to sing--all the beauty of the sea and the sky and the rocks</p>
<p>and the--loneliness and the heart beauty--wasn't that grand,</p>
<p>Chita--and from all over the people came to hear her--the most</p>
<p>beautiful singing in the world all filled with the tears that were</p>
<p>shed by the sea----"</p>
<p>"Was that me----"</p>
<p>"Yah--I guess so and----"</p>
<p>"And the girl in the old countree?"</p>
<p>"Oh she--I dunno--she----"</p>
<p>"Didn't her beau----"</p>
<p>"Yah--her beau--the fisherman, I guess, came one day in the fishing</p>
<p>boat----"</p>
<p>"And was she glad?"</p>
<p>"Yah--all her tears--the beautiful tears--were gone and she went with</p>
<p>him then----"</p>
<p>"To clean--the fish?"</p>
<p>"To--clean--the fish."</p>
<p>"I'd rather be me--with all the people in the world coming to hear</p>
<p>me--than cleaning fish----"</p>
<p>"I dunno--Chita--I dunno----."</p>
<p>The upper hall was full of the black twilight and Chita in her puddle</p>
<p>had scarcely scrubbed her way forward at all. It was Bertha who had</p>
<p>come scouring down the hallway toward her. They met on all fours</p>
<p>there at one end of the gloom. Chita with her little bright eyes</p>
<p>shining in amber tunnels like Jocko's. The hulk of Bertha.</p>
<p>"Kiss me, Bertha."</p>
<p>"Oh Chita. Chita."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Something hateful happened. On Dearborn Street near Front was a</p>
<p>pretty brick house, conspicuous for its undilapidated shutters and</p>
<p>polished doorplate. Bertha passed it upon those rare occasions when</p>
<p>she walked out. It was next to a meat stall, where she went to buy</p>
<p>lamb-neck for stew. Annie's favorite dish. A small meticulous house</p>
<p>with something of the narrow-shouldered air of a lady missionary.</p>
<p>The little white ruching of front steps. The pious precisions. The</p>
<p>exactitude of window shades like eyelids discreetly lowered for</p>
<p>prayer. That polished doorplate! It has a habit of moving along</p>
<p>sedately before Bertha's eyes to the meat stall and back again.</p>
<p>Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Society for the</p>
<p>prevention of cruelty to children.</p>
<p>Chita's tan, taut little body with the blue spots running up her leg.</p>
<p>There was even one on her tiny, lovely breast. A lurid, frightening</p>
<p>purple. And Chita's eyelids were peculiarly red at the rims and her</p>
<p>feet inflamed looking, probably merely because she loved so to dance,</p>
<p>but her toes were all curled under, in a prehensile fashion.</p>
<p>Bertha liked to rub them warm, until the blood circulated, and to</p>
<p>anoint the bruises with the many different liniments she was lavish</p>
<p>at buying. And the reefer! To unbutton it from its warm fastenings</p>
<p>when Chita arrived in the morning and to button it up snugly in</p>
<p>double-breasted fashion when Chita went home at night! Sometimes as</p>
<p>it hung on its peg all day Bertha would button it there, and then</p>
<p>unfasten it again. Chita's little reefer. Chita.</p>
<p>So resolutely, she kept her head away from that small polished sign.</p>
<p>But even so, it was screwed to her eyes. "Society for the Prevention</p>
<p>of Cruelty to Children." She scrubbed floors through it, she stirred</p>
<p>stew of veal through it. She saw Chita through it. She shook open a</p>
<p>gray blanket to make up a sailor's cot, and there it stared up at</p>
<p>her. Society-for-the-Pre-vention-of-Cruelty-to-Children.</p>
<p>Then the something hateful happened.</p>
<p>There were three freighters in and the men were sleeping two on a</p>
<p>cot, and floor pallets were to be made up, and all morning Bertha had</p>
<p>been hoisting mattresses up the narrow stairway, even Annie, who</p>
<p>could walk a little now, hobbling as far as the foot of the steps</p>
<p>with an armful of pillows. Chita was like Jocko and Jocko like</p>
<p>Chita. They scampered over banisters. Slid downstairs and rode up</p>
<p>on Bertha's shoulder. Only with Annie about, one had to be very</p>
<p>spry, and by noon Chita had made sixteen cots and filled all the wash</p>
<p>pitchers. Usually Bertha filled these for her, but Annie's eyes</p>
<p>seemed to have the power of turning the corner of the upper halls, so</p>
<p>Chita lugged and tugged alone and her breath came very short, and the</p>
<p>red rims around her eyes seemed almost wet with blood.</p>
<p>The men began to swagger in on sea legs. Rum. The smell of it</p>
<p>ticklingly through the hallways. Annie back in the keg room now,</p>
<p>whacking her knees with the best of them.</p>
<p>"Chita--you bane tired, poor baby. You can rest now. I will do it</p>
<p>for you."</p>
<p>"They hurt," said Chita and rubbing her arms began to cry. She never</p>
<p>cried to Annie.</p>
<p>Bertha rubbed them, the little bony fragile things, and blew on them</p>
<p>with her strong, hot breath. The room was in appalling disorder, the</p>
<p>sprawling cots, the mounds of mattresses, the dirty waters of</p>
<p>yesterday gathering scum in bowls. Thirty cots to be made and</p>
<p>already the seamen, lurching as if the world were a deck beneath</p>
<p>them, were sprawling in, loony with land.</p>
<p>One came in on her tussling with her man's task of getting mattresses</p>
<p>laid, a Scandinavian whom she knew by the name of Tor. He was one of</p>
<p>the troublesome ones, and he swung his arms around her waist, and she</p>
<p>shoved him from her with a force that sent him backward, down on one</p>
<p>of the half unfurled mattresses, and almost immediately he was asleep</p>
<p>and she dragged him to a corner, and there he lay for twenty-two</p>
<p>hours, like a dog, snoring.</p>
<p>And then suddenly, while she was dragging these mattresses into</p>
<p>place, Bertha missed Chita. Chita who danced so nimbly in her shadow</p>
<p>all day and ran up her shoulder like Jocko.</p>
<p>"Chita," she cried, and j'erked the pillows this way and that as if</p>
<p>she might have been a kitten, hiding. "Chita!"</p>
<p>There should have been nothing frightening about Chita bounding off</p>
<p>that way. But suddenly the silence seemed to have a little pulse to</p>
<p>it. It beat in Bertha's throat. And so she ran about the long</p>
<p>ward-like room, peering under pillows and mattresses for all the</p>
<p>world as if she were looking for the kitten.</p>
<p>"Chita!"</p>
<p>In the hallways was the hot pulsing silence too, except down in the</p>
<p>keg room there was laughter; crazy, skating laughter.</p>
<p>"Chita!"</p>
<p>There was a closet at the end of the hall, almost as large as a room</p>
<p>and with a skylight. It was filled with such miscellaneous old</p>
<p>refuse as a broken chair, leaky pails, the Australian sailor's</p>
<p>lambswool jacket, bottles, brooms, and a rusty gas stove.</p>
<p>Somehow, the door to this closet seemed to blow out at Bertha like a</p>
<p>woman's skirt. She opened it. There were Chita and a young Italian</p>
<p>sailor off a fruit ship. He had a face like a carved almond.</p>
<p>Narrow. Slit. White. And his fingers were quick and caressing over</p>
<p>Chita's little body, as if she had been a harp, and there she lay</p>
<p>back in his arms, her eyes, usually as quick as Jocko's, suddenly</p>
<p>like fresh and flowing waters that had been dammed. Stagnant and a</p>
<p>little heavy with mud. Chita lying back there, drugged-looking and</p>
<p>with her agile young limbs tranced. Chita--Chita lying back there</p>
<p>with her stagnant-looking eyes and her dancing limbs that were</p>
<p>suddenly full of a dreadful kind of languor.</p>
<p>The sailor oozed away. Literally. Because under Bertha's very eyes,</p>
<p>he was gone, leaving Chita on the chair like a doll that had been</p>
<p>cast there, along with other broken things.</p>
<p>"Chita----"</p>
<p>She began to whimper and dodge back.</p>
<p>"Diden do nawthin'----"</p>
<p>"Come here--to Bertha----"</p>
<p>"You can't hit me--you're not me mudder."</p>
<p>"Bertha won't hit you, Baby. Chita--come--to me----"</p>
<p>But Chita was still afraid, and it was almost like luring Jocko, to</p>
<p>unlock her tight fingers from the chair arm, and draw her out of her</p>
<p>tight crouch in the corner.</p>
<p>"I diden do nawthin'--lemme alone."</p>
<p>"Chita--little Chita."</p>
<p>It was dead in the old closet. Stale smelling. For an hour Bertha</p>
<p>held Chita there, in her big, man-sized arms. Close. Pressing her</p>
<p>little boniness against her breast, while the beat of her heart</p>
<p>pounded through.</p>
<p>Below the men were swaggering in now, outlandish with their packs and</p>
<p>bags of luggage, and downstairs Annie's voice, shouting for Bertha</p>
<p>and shouting for Chita, kept screaming out oaths between greetings.</p>
<p>"Bertha--was I almost being bad----"</p>
<p>"Yes, Chita. Terribly. Terribly bad."</p>
<p>"I won't no more, Bertha. My Bertha. You're cryin'----"</p>
<p>"For you, Chita."</p>
<p>"No, Bertha, I'm gonna be good--Bertha--what's that on your insides?</p>
<p>A heart--it's ticking--like a clock."</p>
<p>"For you, Chita."</p>
<p>"Tick--Bertha--for me----"</p>
<p>She fell asleep, and finally Annie's oaths died down in the</p>
<p>hullabaloo of arrivals, and the great empty barracks of a room with</p>
<p>the unmade cots and the half-furled mattresses stood waiting, and the</p>
<p>skylight over the closet turned taupe, and down in the keg room the</p>
<p>shoutings rose and somebody must have overturned a tray of glasses</p>
<p>because a crash splintered the silence and, under cover of it, Bertha</p>
<p>shook Chita gently awake and buttoned her into her reefer. It was</p>
<p>dusk and she walked home with her down to the mouth of a filthy</p>
<p>street on the lower West Side.</p>
<p>"Good night, Bertha--my--Bertha----"</p>
<p>"Good night--Chita--mine----"</p>
<p>She watched her scamper down the street, nimble once more as Jocko,</p>
<p>and up into the black mouth of a tenement.</p>
<p>The way back was through a district of torchlit pushcarts and the</p>
<p>flicker of pale wastrel faces. There was a waving light before the</p>
<p>meat stall. The meticulous little house with the narrow shoulders of</p>
<p>a lady missionary stood out of the glare. Neatly. The shutters were</p>
<p>closed, but there was a fan of lit transom above the door.</p>
<p>Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.</p>
<p>Ringing the bell above that small sign, a tear meandered down to the</p>
<p>corner of Bertha's lips.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was noon of the next day when they came to take Chita. She was</p>
<p>washing the iron grating of a ground-floor window, the grotesque</p>
<p>bulbs of her knees rubbing and shivering as she reached.</p>
<p>Bertha lifted back her wisp of furiously sooty little panties to show</p>
<p>the purple smears. A cranberry of a little man rubbed his chin and</p>
<p>said "M-m-m-m" and a young woman in an alpine hat opened her notebook.</p>
<p>"Chita--these bane good people here--to help you."</p>
<p>Suddenly the little monkey-like focus of Chita's gaze seemed to slide</p>
<p>right down the bridge of her nose and up to Bertha!</p>
<p>"Cops!" she cried and sprang back.</p>
<p>"No, Chita--good people----"</p>
<p>"Cops! You dirty snitch. You got the cops on me--the plain closes</p>
<p>bulls--you dirty bloke--I diden do nawthin--he was a dago sailor and</p>
<p>he gimme a dime--that's all--you dirty square head--snitch--the lord</p>
<p>hates a snitch--me brud'--he'll knock the stuffin's out of</p>
<p>you--snitch you--dirty square head snitch--I'll sick me brud' on</p>
<p>you----"</p>
<p>They carried Chita struggling between them into the little enclosed</p>
<p>wagonette at the curb. A light tan omnibus with curtains at the</p>
<p>window of the rear door.</p>
<p>"Chita," cried Bertha, and stood there with the tears raining down</p>
<p>her cheeks, "Chita--mine----"</p>
<p>"Bloke--you--dirty--snitch--bloke!"</p>
<p>Against the little window of the rear door of the omnibus, her simian</p>
<p>little furious face with the Jocko eyes and the twitchings of rage</p>
<p>grimaced back at her.</p>
<p>"Bloke--dirty snitch--square-head--hate yuh--lunk----"</p>
<p>Chita who had loved so to listen to the tick of Bertha's heart.</p>
<p>Chita. After a while the face became a blur.</p>
<p>Chita----</p>
<p>The window gratings were only half washed. The pail was still there.</p>
<p>"Chita," cried Bertha and plunged in her brush. "Oh God--my</p>
<p>Chita--gone----"</p>
<p>Rub-a-dub-dub. Scrub-a-dub-dub.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Annie paid Bertha twenty dollars a month, when she paid it. Usually</p>
<p>during these bedridden weeks of Annie's, there was a household</p>
<p>deficit which Bertha dug down into the pocket of her gray flannel</p>
<p>petticoat to meet.</p>
<p>The wad with the rubber band about it, which had a friendly way of</p>
<p>hitting against Bertha's leg when she walked, was very light now.</p>
<p>At the Wallensteins' it had fattened out into quite a roll of soft</p>
<p>dirty bills. Her wants were so meager. The Sailors' Supply Store</p>
<p>filled them mostly, and a sliver of a shop on the Bowery where the</p>
<p>kind of flannel waists she wore, flopped on hangers outside the door.</p>
<p>But invariably in the end, one way or another, Annie wormed away</p>
<p>these little savings, so that her intervals of unemployment had a</p>
<p>frightening way of draining her petticoat pocket. Frightening,</p>
<p>because somehow that wad, hitting against her when she walked, meant</p>
<p>a pad between her and she knew what! The women one passed at night</p>
<p>with dragging hems and twitching faces. The crones picking out of</p>
<p>refuse boxes and asleep in doorways. The girls in dreadful finery</p>
<p>soliciting along the wharves.</p>
<p>That hit-hit against her leg. It could seem as if someone were</p>
<p>walking in step with her.</p>
<p>Then one day the wad petered out into a mere handful of change, left</p>
<p>from a dollar bill with which she had purchased a bottle of</p>
<p>sarsaparilla for Jocko, who loved to drink it out of the bottle and</p>
<p>rub his little belly.</p>
<p>A shudder went down her back. Ninety-five cents in silver. The hit</p>
<p>gone from against her leg. The women one passed at night with the</p>
<p>dragging hems....</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was new management at Raussman's. An unctuous Bohemian with a</p>
<p>pimply face sorted out the human stock. All the young girls sat in</p>
<p>the front row with their big red hands like beef-steaks on their</p>
<p>laps. The older women were placed against the wall. They seemed to</p>
<p>sit hugging themselves underneath their jackets and sighed a great</p>
<p>deal. Some of cold, because the gin fires had gone out. Some of</p>
<p>fatigue, and some of an unutterable hopelessness that pulled down</p>
<p>their eyelids like window shades. There was considerable traffic</p>
<p>among the young girls in the front row. The alert Bohemian was kept</p>
<p>busy between the telephone, the passing out of slips, and the arrival</p>
<p>of clients.</p>
<p>The assorted display in the front row was in a constant state of</p>
<p>change, as if someone kept plucking bonbons from a box and almost</p>
<p>immediately the little fluted container would be replaced with</p>
<p>another.</p>
<p>The row against the wall did not change much. The faces were grimmer</p>
<p>and the slow frieze of them would sit sometimes uninterrupted</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>Bertha found herself in this back row of the waiting faces, most of</p>
<p>them flecked with fear. Not Bertha's. Hers was so big and so pale.</p>
<p>Like a light. It burned roundly and patiently through the greasy</p>
<p>twilit days at Raussman's. But after several of the futile ones of</p>
<p>waiting, there were just twenty-five cents left in the petticoat</p>
<p>pocket.</p>
<p>Then she began to buy newspapers and pore over them. It was November</p>
<p>and the parks were old and gray-looking and newspapers ballooned up</p>
<p>in the wind unless you sat on one end and nailed the other to the</p>
<p>bench with your palm.</p>
<p>HELP WANTED, FEMALE</p>
<p>Columns of it, yet the dread of going the rounds. The women</p>
<p>aggrieved with the servant problem, who asked abashing intimate</p>
<p>questions, and weighed out the weekly consignment of second-grade</p>
<p>butter and eggs for the help. The women aggrieved with the servant</p>
<p>problem, who provided kennels for sleeping and railed at high wages</p>
<p>for the fourteen-hour day. The dread of starting those rounds. Help</p>
<p>Wanted, Female.</p>
<p>The park benches were strewn with discarded newspapers, turned almost</p>
<p>invariably to the classified advertisement page. Sometimes a little</p>
<p>oblong had been torn out with a hair pin or penknife. One day in</p>
<p>City Hall Park, poring over one of these left overs, this one burned</p>
<p>up at Bertha from its little enclosure:</p>
<p>Wanted: Practical nurse to assist governess in care of five-year-old</p>
<p>boy. Must be well trained and efficient. References. Apply W.</p>
<p>Bixby, 3450 Madison Avenue.</p>
<p>It was a rowdy of a day. Whistling, prankish winds that flew up</p>
<p>under capes and rushed newspapers along the curving walks of the</p>
<p>park. A pecksniffy little gale that filled the air with dust and</p>
<p>paper. Pedestrians hustled before it and the benches were pretty</p>
<p>well swept, except for one or two hunches of men asleep under their</p>
<p>hats and the hoppings of sparrows aiming for empty peanut hulls. And</p>
<p>Bertha. She sat forward, her torso a little oblique as if someone</p>
<p>had placed a broken urn there on a slant, and the look that she had</p>
<p>lifted up from that newspaper insertion, pinioned to her face.</p>
<p>The city ran past her. Dived into subway hoods. Clamored over</p>
<p>cobbles. Honked, whizzed, banged. Park Row had just spewed out a</p>
<p>red-hot edition and the newsboys' howls ran high.</p>
<p>It was strange to be there in the midst of life when the heart was as</p>
<p>dreary as a moor. Wasteland down which she could see herself</p>
<p>stalking, brooding and terrible with the tears that were dry and sobs</p>
<p>that were silent. She began to walk. It was very far. The city</p>
<p>blocks streamed behind, one after another. They were so full of</p>
<p>life. But the moor gathering around her heart, it encompassed her.</p>
<p>The house on Madison Avenue was as handsome and portly as a park</p>
<p>statue of a gentleman in a frock coat. It had an air and a gracious,</p>
<p>portentous dignity, as if any moment the double oak doors might swing</p>
<p>back and someone important and lovely sweep down the fine curve of</p>
<p>stone steps. Candlelight would gleam on old silver in such a house</p>
<p>and the kettles in such a house would be of polished copper that</p>
<p>swelled what they reflected. Fine, drum shaped kettles, that would</p>
<p>draw the juices out of fowl.</p>
<p>The curtains were frilled net and did an elaborate crisscross in the</p>
<p>center of the long windows, and then drew back to reveal the shoulder</p>
<p>of a chair or the dim loveliness of marble statuary. A child in such</p>
<p>a house could, if he wanted, peer out of that little open place</p>
<p>between the curtains. He would probably leave five fingerprints</p>
<p>against the pane. Spudgy little fingerprints that would polish off</p>
<p>with a dry cloth. But there were no fingerprints against the panes.</p>
<p>They were very shiny. Peer as she would with the corners of her eyes</p>
<p>as she passed the house, up the block, down the block, there were no</p>
<p>fingerprints against the panes.</p>
<p>It was easy to pass and repass. That is, if one kept shoulders bent</p>
<p>into the wind as if with destination. There was a constant trickle</p>
<p>of pedestrians along the fine wide avenue. One swung back and forth</p>
<p>with the little tides. No stopping to stare, of course. Just that</p>
<p>tail of the eye, ready!</p>
<p>It was a block of portly houses. Of great wide windows and curving</p>
<p>stoops and motor cars at the curb. There were several ways of not</p>
<p>passing up and down too often. Walking on the opposite side.</p>
<p>Appearing to stand at a corner for the traffic to pass. Strolling</p>
<p>around the block and loitering a little along the way.</p>
<p>Not even the smudge of a sprawled little palm against the window</p>
<p>pane. How precious had there been!</p>
<p>Once a young woman entered the trade entrance. She had a click to</p>
<p>her broad heels and there was a gleam of starched white under her</p>
<p>long blue cape. The door was opened to her only the fraction of an</p>
<p>inch and closed again, gently. She went away on heels not so</p>
<p>clicking. Bertha, passing, could have touched her.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after, a big heavy-busted woman, with hair on her</p>
<p>chin and also in white uniform that crackled under her cloak, rang</p>
<p>the bell. Bertha knew her! A Mrs. Mahaffy! She had once tended the</p>
<p>senile grandfather in a private house on Lexington Avenue where</p>
<p>Bertha had cooked for a month. "Hateful Mahaffy" the waitress had</p>
<p>called her. She was always fussing around the kitchen with trays,</p>
<p>mostly her own, and had let the old man fall in his bath one morning,</p>
<p>for which she was dismissed. Her arms were pock-marked too. The</p>
<p>waitress had stumbled across a little nest of hypodermic needles</p>
<p>under her mattress after she left.</p>
<p>Hateful Mahaffy!</p>
<p>Passive Bertha with her slow, white face. A sudden, a new, an</p>
<p>aggressive rage laid hold of her. A frenzy that made her want to</p>
<p>tear and strip and choke. She started after the largely undulating</p>
<p>figure of Mrs. Mahaffy, but the one inch of door had already been</p>
<p>opened and closed to her, so that they met on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Save yourself the trouble," said Mrs. Mahaffy, "the place is already</p>
<p>filled."</p>
<p>She had a horrid kind of voice for a woman. It seemed to want to</p>
<p>boom because she had hair on her chin. Then she recognized Bertha.</p>
<p>"Wasn't we in a place together once? Lexington Avenue."</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"Well, you're in wrong here. Practical nurse is wanted. Big</p>
<p>automobile moguls from Detroit. Just moved here. New-rich. Give me</p>
<p>the new-rich every time. They got proper respect for their servants,</p>
<p>and not too much for themselves. Well, stung here, but they're</p>
<p>engaging a new staff in that big brown house over on the corner.</p>
<p>Want to come with me?"</p>
<p>"No," said Bertha. "No."</p>
<p>"Well, you always was good company for yourself," said Mrs. Mahaffy</p>
<p>and stalked off on a diagonal across the street.</p>
<p>Hateful Mahaffy, who, they said of her, pinched children, and had let</p>
<p>the old man slip and break his hip. To think that hateful Mahaffy,</p>
<p>with the boom of voice, might have gained custody over the child</p>
<p>within that house.</p>
<p>Or someone like her might already have been hired! Or someone worse!</p>
<p>Fear flashed through her. Flash after flash of it. Then again the</p>
<p>swelling anger. Mrs. Mahaffy. She pinched children. She started</p>
<p>across the street, striking into her solemn golem trot, her lower lip</p>
<p>pursed out.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mahaffy had disappeared. She hurried a block after her, her</p>
<p>stiff Inverness cape blowing out from her, and her face thrust out</p>
<p>ahead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mahaffy. What had she to do with it? Do with it? Why, there</p>
<p>was a child over there in that house--five years old--who made it</p>
<p>unbearable that any child should be pinched.</p>
<p>She hurried. Mrs. Mahaffy had disappeared. After a while she began</p>
<p>to cry. Slow ashamed tears. The house looked soft through the blur</p>
<p>of them. Almost as if you could poke in a dimple through the wall</p>
<p>with your finger, as you could in the cheek of a child.</p>
<p>A man in shirt sleeves and a black apron came out of the service</p>
<p>entrance and began to polish the brass doorbell. He was shaved to</p>
<p>the skull, and his neck was fat, and he danced up and down from the</p>
<p>knees as he rubbed. A gay feather duster stuck up from his rear hip</p>
<p>pocket. He whistled. She could not tear her eyes from him. His</p>
<p>jouncing legs and the little jelly-dance of the fat along his neck!</p>
<p>Perhaps as recently as an hour ago--ten minutes ago--five--he had</p>
<p>passed the five-year-old child in a hallway. That gay little duster</p>
<p>might have flecked a chair that he had sat upon.</p>
<p>The excitement of that! It ran like a fever through her. She stood</p>
<p>and looked at him. Just stood there in front of the house and</p>
<p>watched him rubbing the bell. After a while he turned, because the</p>
<p>irises of her eyes must by this time have been like hot disks on his</p>
<p>back. He had a face of loose fat and the jowls fell in pleats like a</p>
<p>spaniel's. A soft face that you could mash up softly with your hand</p>
<p>like pie dough. Ugh.</p>
<p>She began to walk and he followed her by swinging his head around to</p>
<p>glance over the other shoulder.</p>
<p>Perhaps so recently as an hour ago--ten minutes--five--he had passed</p>
<p>the five-year-old in a hallway----</p>
<p>He winked.</p>
<p>Slowly and with the horrid sensation that she could softly mash up</p>
<p>his face into pie dough, Bertha winked back.</p>
<p>"Fine day for a walk," he said, and sucked back his words and made a</p>
<p>noise like a kiss.</p>
<p>"Yah," she said and lifted her lips back off her square white teeth</p>
<p>to make a smile.</p>
<p>He was chewing something and he spat, quid and all, on to the stoop</p>
<p>of the house adjoining.</p>
<p>"Big 'un, ain't you?"</p>
<p>"Me? I dunno----"</p>
<p>"Ticklish? Slk-k-k-k-k," he said, and made a sound between his</p>
<p>tongue and his cheek. Nasty. Frightening.</p>
<p>"Naw."</p>
<p>His face was shaved, but the day's stubble of beard was out, and when</p>
<p>he rubbed it you could hear the bristles scrape.</p>
<p>"Good time?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He bunched up his mouth again with the little hissing, kissing sound.</p>
<p>Someone lowered a window with a slam. He flecked open his polishing</p>
<p>rag and began to rub at the bell again.</p>
<p>"Wait for me a few minutes down at the drug store on Thirty-ninth.</p>
<p>I'm off at five. Big 'un, heh?"</p>
<p>She moved off. That face of old dough--ugh!</p>
<p>It was horrible waiting. It grew dusk and she shivered and her</p>
<p>tongue thickened and her distaste kept welling. But her feet stood</p>
<p>rooted, sullen, there. Waiting. The ruby urn in the drug store</p>
<p>window lit up and threw a stain on the sidewalk. He came, looking</p>
<p>stuffed into his coat, and his derby hat sat high on his head like a</p>
<p>rocking chair. He was short. She had not noted how short. Why, she</p>
<p>could have almost leaned an elbow on his head and rested her cheek</p>
<p>comfortably upon her palm.</p>
<p>Silly Willy.</p>
<p>Idiotically enough, that transpired to be his name. Willy. She was</p>
<p>never to utter it without the aftermath of a little chime in her</p>
<p>brain. Silly.</p>
<p>His soft mouth slid around so in his face. It was a little sunken</p>
<p>because his molar teeth were gone. Slk-k-k-k-k! He was always</p>
<p>making that noise between his tongue and his cheek and making a</p>
<p>boring gesture with his forefinger, Slk-k-k-k-k. He met her that way.</p>
<p>"Slk-k-k-k-k, you're a husky one."</p>
<p>"You bane a _little_ one," she said with elephantine coquetry.</p>
<p>"I'm little," he said, "but oh my," and beat himself upon the chest.</p>
<p>"You bane short and I bane long, heh?"</p>
<p>"That's me! Little but oh my--is what they used to label me in</p>
<p>Winnipeg."</p>
<p>"Oh, that bane a big fine place."</p>
<p>"Winnipeg! She's a dream. There's a little city with a gizzard. I</p>
<p>was born there. My boss comes from Detroit. You know him? Ever</p>
<p>been in a Bixby Six? That's him. Every third time you bat your eye</p>
<p>a Bixby car runs past you."</p>
<p>"You bane house-man?"</p>
<p>"Yeh, but I don't live in. I got a room. Good time?"</p>
<p>"It bane a big fine house. It's a fine big family?"</p>
<p>"Big family! There's him and her--fine as silk--and a kid--the</p>
<p>little devil is five----"</p>
<p>"You--know--him----?"</p>
<p>"Little devil--let me so much as be washin' the window of his nursery</p>
<p>and he gets me down on all-fours for a ride on me back."</p>
<p>"Your--back----"</p>
<p>"To-day, if anybody be askin' you--I can feel his little heels in my</p>
<p>shins yet----."</p>
<p>"You!"</p>
<p>"Slk-k-k-k-k! I live over there--near First Avenue. I got a room."</p>
<p>"He rode you--to-day----"</p>
<p>"He's a card--kicked my shins----"</p>
<p>"Will he ride you to-morrow----?"</p>
<p>"Mebbe."</p>
<p>"You like me?"</p>
<p>He threw up a killing glance from under his rocking-chair derby and</p>
<p>poked her under the cape with his forefinger. "Slk-k-k-k-k."</p>
<p>They turned down a crosstown street that ran toward First Avenue.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Willy's room was over a garage where a great mercantile establishment</p>
<p>kept its regiment of trucks. It was large, with one end filled with</p>
<p>traces; the body of an old horse-drawn delivery wagon and some old</p>
<p>leather harnesses that smelled.</p>
<p>The front part of the room had a bed and a chair and a table and a</p>
<p>small stove the shape of a snow man. Bertha hung some muslin</p>
<p>portières up one day. That cut the room in two and shut off the</p>
<p>wagon top, with a red star and R.H. Stacy and Company painted across</p>
<p>it. This seemed to move the chair, the table, the bed, and the stove</p>
<p>into a cozier propinquity. Otherwise, it was rather an awful room.</p>
<p>It stood there cold and mean and bare all day, scarcely more than a</p>
<p>kennel, waiting for the occupants who called it home, to creep back</p>
<p>into it at night.</p>
<p>Willy usually came first. It was a straight cut cross town, from the</p>
<p>house on Madison Avenue. Bertha's hours were more irregular. Her</p>
<p>work took her far and wide.</p>
<p>Once, during Christmas holidays, an agency on East Twenty-third</p>
<p>Street which kept her constantly supplied with day-work sent her,</p>
<p>along with a staff, to clean a schoolhouse on East One Hundred and</p>
<p>Ninety-second Street. It was ten o'clock before she climbed to the</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>Willy was asleep on the bed with his shoes on and his derby hat over</p>
<p>his face. There was no fire and no supper. Willy could cook. He</p>
<p>had always lived off like this in a room with a bed and a stove. But</p>
<p>with the advent of Bertha an atavism cropped out in him. The stove</p>
<p>might be laid, but unless she struck the match, there was no fire.</p>
<p>It was easier to be cold and hungry and lie on the bed with his derby</p>
<p>over his face, waiting.</p>
<p>"You're a lunk," Bertha cried one night and hit him across the soles</p>
<p>of his shoes with a poker, as he lay stretched and waiting on top of</p>
<p>the bed.</p>
<p>"Then get out," he said, and turned over and dozed off until the fire</p>
<p>began to crackle in the round little belly of the stove and the</p>
<p>strong smell of tripe stew to wind through the room.</p>
<p>He was vicious, but in the small ways that a terrier can be vicious.</p>
<p>Yappy. Snappy. But the crack of a whip could curl his legs under</p>
<p>him and make him slink. He had the mind of a child. Colored picture</p>
<p>cards amused. He could not drink, and what he chewed was tobacco</p>
<p>substitute, and his pockets were filled with bits of bright glass and</p>
<p>twine and pencil stubs and old screws. Even his vices were not man</p>
<p>size. He was sly and he was a thief, but he stole only pennies and</p>
<p>doll's eyes and no one in the Bixby household could call a pen-knife</p>
<p>or scratch-pad his own. He was constantly filching the smaller coins</p>
<p>from Bertha's pocketbook. Coppers. She could feel his hand steal</p>
<p>under the leather cushion that was her pillow and would lie there in</p>
<p>the darkness with her eyes wide open, looking at the dim white smear</p>
<p>his teeth made across the darkness when he laid them bare in his</p>
<p>effort at stealth.</p>
<p>Silly Willy. He was not even a man. That made it less horrible,</p>
<p>even while it made it more horrible. She slept on the other side of</p>
<p>the muslin curtain, on the long leather seat of the old delivery</p>
<p>wagon. It made quite a couch. Only her feet dangled off, and she</p>
<p>could crowd them in if she drew up her knees. It was almost private,</p>
<p>except that he liked to peer through to see the gleam of her hair.</p>
<p>Unbound it fell in a slow cascade of heavy, solemn, taffy-looking</p>
<p>yellow.</p>
<p>"Get out! Sca-at!"</p>
<p>He didn't always, and had to be pushed out like a hateful boy. She</p>
<p>despised him and was never free of the feeling that his face was</p>
<p>boneless and made of dough, and that by the pressure of her palm</p>
<p>against it something terrifying and feature-less would be left there</p>
<p>before her.</p>
<p>And yet when Bertha came home from work with her pulpous brown</p>
<p>butcher's package, and her arms stinging from lye water and the</p>
<p>sockets aching, sometimes she could not run up the stairs fast</p>
<p>enough, skinning her shins and stumbling in her haste.</p>
<p>Willy would be there. Silly Willy. And he could show her the very</p>
<p>spot along his back where the boy had straddled, riding him horseback</p>
<p>and kicking into his shins. Once he had come home with the skin on</p>
<p>his arm torn. The boy had flecked him too hard with a whip. Bertha</p>
<p>washed it and kissed it. Kissed that wound on the hairless arm of</p>
<p>Silly Willy.</p>
<p>It was easy to make him talk. A sack of little cone-shaped chocolate</p>
<p>drops would accomplish it, or a new screw driver, or a roll of</p>
<p>adhesive plaster. Any little tinkery thing. And because he was sly,</p>
<p>he would only answer Slk-k-k-k-k to her questions until she produced</p>
<p>the bribe. It never bothered him to know the why of her trembling</p>
<p>interest in the boy. He just was silly and would talk for a</p>
<p>cone-shaped chocolate drop.</p>
<p>Sometimes at the Bixby house, instead of his emptying ashes or</p>
<p>washing windows or polishing brass, they would detain him in the</p>
<p>nursery on a rainy day to play those straddling floor games that the</p>
<p>starchy nurse could not manage. Silly Willy could amble on all fours</p>
<p>for hours. He would buckle on a leather harness that had bells,</p>
<p>shake himself and roar, and the boy, straddling his back, would kick</p>
<p>with his heels and shout.</p>
<p>Silly Willy was good at these games. He played them sincerely and</p>
<p>with the mind of a child.</p>
<p>Sometimes the boy stole down to the furnace rooms, where Willy kept</p>
<p>fires banked, and looked with solemn pools of eyes into the red maw</p>
<p>of the boiler. He had rather a frail, choir-boy face with long</p>
<p>cheeks and very straight yellow bangs which came down to his brows.</p>
<p>He could stare into the fire until the black irises almost crowded</p>
<p>out the blue in his eyes and his cheeks began to redden. He liked</p>
<p>fire. It fascinated him. Infuriated him. He would contemplate it,</p>
<p>then catch up a broom and ride hobby-horse astride it like one</p>
<p>possessed. Usually Willy followed, more feebly, on a second</p>
<p>broomstick.</p>
<p>His nurse or his mother usually precipitated this and Willy on his</p>
<p>springy knees would wabble back to the fire, to feed it, to sit in</p>
<p>its red stain, and to chuckle.</p>
<p>Sometimes in good outdoor weather or with the family away, there</p>
<p>would be no sign of the boy for days, for weeks. That was dull for</p>
<p>Willie. He liked to play. But Willie was sly.</p>
<p>For a bag of the chocolate drops or a screw or a ball of twine, he</p>
<p>would invent the day's encounter with the boy. Nothing very</p>
<p>ingenious. Willy's imagination was a feeble affair. Just a sort of</p>
<p>refurbishings of oft told tales.</p>
<p>Bertha did not mind. No sooner had they sat down with their dish of</p>
<p>dinner steaming up between them, than her hand made its insidious</p>
<p>curve down toward her pocket.</p>
<p>And then without any particular preamble Willy would begin: "He's a</p>
<p>devil for fire. He is. Gets his owl eyes full of it from staring</p>
<p>and then goes crazy with it. He's a fire horse. So am I. We're a</p>
<p>team of fire horses."</p>
<p>"Willy--that's a dangerous play!"</p>
<p>"Dangerous! You got to straddle your horse tight. That's all. Hold</p>
<p>'im in--is what I tells him--hold 'im in and you're all right."</p>
<p>"Is he strong enough to hold 'im in?"</p>
<p>"Naw. That's where I come in. Slk-k-k-k! I rein him up!"</p>
<p>"Willy--tell me again--what does he look like--the little boy?"</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you--again and again and again----"</p>
<p>"Yoost once--more, Willy."</p>
<p>"Is it chocolates? Gimme."</p>
<p>"What does he look like?"</p>
<p>"He's a boy--he is, with eyes and hair----"</p>
<p>"Yellow, Willy? His hair bane yellow--like mine?"</p>
<p>"It's yellow all right."</p>
<p>"He's a big boy, Willy?"</p>
<p>"I showed you on the wall--he bane that high."</p>
<p>"That was last week--he bane bigger now?"</p>
<p>"Aw--not quick--like that--gimme what you've got. Chocolate?"</p>
<p>She handed him the sack of cones, for his dessert.</p>
<p>One evening over the strong smell of their kidney stew he screwed up</p>
<p>his eyes at her!</p>
<p>"I give him one--to-day."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>His eyes looked sly and almost at once that frightened her.</p>
<p>"What--Willy----?"</p>
<p>They disappeared as if dough had crowded up around two raisins.</p>
<p>"Willy--one what?"</p>
<p>"One of my chocolates!"</p>
<p>She rose up sudden and threatening as an apparition, her two arms</p>
<p>towering as if they would crash down upon him, and he cowed in his</p>
<p>chair with his mouth fallen open.</p>
<p>"You gave him from those----"</p>
<p>"Yeh----"</p>
<p>"He ate----"</p>
<p>"Naw--we put it in the fire. It melted up. Get away. You!"</p>
<p>She came down from the great towering gesture of her wrath, which he</p>
<p>interpreted not at all, and her fingers unclenched and the blood went</p>
<p>back into her face. She shook him then, by the scroff of his coat</p>
<p>until his head bobbed loosely.</p>
<p>"Don't you ever--don't you ever again--give him those ten cent cones."</p>
<p>"Stingy-gut, Slk-k-k-k-k--I only gave one----"</p>
<p>"Never. You hear, Willy. It bane bad for the boy. You--you'll get</p>
<p>fired. Make him sick. I'll bring you chocolates for him. Not your</p>
<p>kind. Chocolates for him----"</p>
<p>"Yeh, we're fire horses."</p>
<p>Chocolates for him! She could not sleep that night. Her feet kept</p>
<p>plunging off the end of the seat and sometimes she sat up in the</p>
<p>leather-smelling darkness because she breathed too fast and felt</p>
<p>crowded.</p>
<p>She bought a dollar box the next day. A red paper affair with a dog</p>
<p>and a boy on the cover. Stale bonbons that had lain in the</p>
<p>incandescent glare of a Third Avenue window for weeks.</p>
<p>The boy never received them. Bertha did not know, but he had been in</p>
<p>Asheville, North Carolina, for three weeks with his foster parents.</p>
<p>Willy ate the chocolates beside the glow of his furnace, popping them</p>
<p>whole into his mouth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Willy had slacked. Shamefully. He no longer paid the rent for the</p>
<p>room, eight dollars a month. Bertha did. The first time she did it</p>
<p>because he wanted a tool chest for seven dollars and eighty-five</p>
<p>cents in a First Avenue show window. After that he never paid</p>
<p>anything. Bertha didn't demur. It was too precious, coming home in</p>
<p>the evening to Willy who that very day might have been galloping like</p>
<p>a fire horse for the boy.</p>
<p>Tools. They grew in a pile. His complete earnings, forty dollars a</p>
<p>month, went into them. He liked to sit and polish them. Test the</p>
<p>ductility of saws, run his plane around the floor for the curl of the</p>
<p>shavings. There were boxes of nails in assorted sizes. Screws.</p>
<p>Gimlets of every graduated variety. He could bore with them for an</p>
<p>entire evening into a bit of plank or the flank of the old delivery</p>
<p>wagon top. Bore and bore with a little mousy sound. He liked that</p>
<p>best. Slk-k-k-k-k! He never made anything. Only bored and sawed</p>
<p>and piddled.</p>
<p>Sometimes Bertha sewed. Made the muslin portières. Patched his</p>
<p>denim house-jacket.</p>
<p>Usually she was so tired evenings that to the sound of the mousy</p>
<p>borings she fell asleep behind her portières. Day-work was draining.</p>
<p>It was like undergoing the dreadful preliminaries of a new job each</p>
<p>morning.</p>
<p>"You can put your shoes there under the sink and there's a chair down</p>
<p>in the basement where you can hang your hat and coat. You don't go</p>
<p>stocking-footed, do you? Gracious, that agency is getting the limit</p>
<p>for day-help. Here's a pail and a mop. You can scrub this whole</p>
<p>courtyard in a morning, if you're spry. My former girl did it before</p>
<p>she got consumption. If that drain there backs water on you, ram</p>
<p>your arm down."</p>
<p>Day after day of it. Day-jobs where the residuum of dirty work was</p>
<p>apt to lie waiting and accumulated. Wet, sloppy, puddled days.</p>
<p>Cold, gaunt houses about to be occupied. Public buildings with rooms</p>
<p>full of the stench of neglect. Once, at a fishmonger's, scales clung</p>
<p>to her arms. Shining fish scales that hung to the flesh like burrs</p>
<p>and would not wash off. She scrubbed at the faucet, and suddenly</p>
<p>panic of them, the wet, slimy things, seized her and she screamed.</p>
<p>The fishmonger, enormous and stained and with a mallet for pounding</p>
<p>down codfish steaks in his hand, came and plucked off a few of them</p>
<p>for her and laughed, and then, because her arm was white and firm,</p>
<p>kissed her with wet, fish-smelling lips. She struck him with his own</p>
<p>mallet by jerking back his arm until he hit himself in the head, and</p>
<p>in his rage he struck back and she went home discharged and with a</p>
<p>blue welt coming out above her cheek bone.</p>
<p>Cold dirty days. Then hot days, equally dirty.</p>
<p>That way the months swung around and, through the poor silly eyes of</p>
<p>Willy, she beheld the boy grow older.</p>
<p>And as the eyes of Willy became sillier, and the face around them</p>
<p>more and more horridly doughy, Bertha, who hated him, was glad. As</p>
<p>he receded more and more into childishness, he played with the mind</p>
<p>and the heart of an innocent. Sometimes, on spring evenings, after</p>
<p>his supper, he joined the street boys at baseball or swapped some of</p>
<p>his shiny screws for chinies. Bertha, sitting up behind the window</p>
<p>curtain, would watch him. Carefully. He was kind to children.</p>
<p>He had come to hate her in a sly and secret kind of way. He was</p>
<p>cunning enough to know she paid the rent and bought the meat for</p>
<p>stews and that, by grace of her, the stack of his shining tools grew</p>
<p>high, but there festered in him, day by day, the desire to torture</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>The same impulse, doubtless, that led him to delight in tearing off</p>
<p>the wings of flies. Or perhaps dimly she was to him the badge of his</p>
<p>impotence, and so he smouldered against her and hated. He had never</p>
<p>been a man, and yet the pangs of impotence made him more horrible</p>
<p>than he might have been with desire.</p>
<p>He liked to grimace at her with every torturous twist of feature he</p>
<p>could connive. To awaken her by hanging over her couch with his face</p>
<p>all drooly and loose of feature like an idiot's, and his hands</p>
<p>drooping loosely from the wrists so that they swept her face.</p>
<p>The horror of this made her wild. She would tremble for an entire</p>
<p>day from the start of waking up to this loose, drooling face of</p>
<p>Willy's. He was devilish at these little abuses. One day he brought</p>
<p>the window sharply on her hands as she leaned over the sill, so that</p>
<p>it made her finger nails blue. He never failed to scratch down</p>
<p>deeply into her palms if he had occasion to take anything from her,</p>
<p>and one evening he wanted to hand her the red hot poker and when she</p>
<p>saw the ruse and held the hand behind her, he brought it down on her</p>
<p>shoulder so that it singed her waist and the flesh.</p>
<p>But he was kind to children.</p>
<p>There was only about one way to deal with him. To slap him.</p>
<p>Usually, with his ears boxed, he could be trusted to trot over to his</p>
<p>tools and begin to plane or bore. Sometimes the cartwright's child</p>
<p>next door would come to play. Together they would set up the racket</p>
<p>of carpentry. Particularly with the plane, improvising mustachios</p>
<p>and fierce whiskers out of the shavings. Sometimes he carried a</p>
<p>handful of the shavings to the boy.</p>
<p>The mystery of the will to live. Not a morning but what Bertha knew</p>
<p>the terrible reluctance of awakening to reality. She came up out of</p>
<p>sleep with a struggle, fighting off another day; turning her back to</p>
<p>it and lying there sick with its imminence as the muslin portières</p>
<p>began to lighten. To come out of sleep so enamored of it that to</p>
<p>feel the lids lift back from the eyes was torture. To die a little</p>
<p>every night and yet fear the beauty of death more than the starkness</p>
<p>of life. Sometimes when Bertha came up out of sleep, fighting and</p>
<p>sobbing against the awakening and the grimacing face of Willy hung</p>
<p>over her terrible with reality, the impulse to throttle herself back</p>
<p>to sleep seemed too strong to withstand. And yet that wink of dawn</p>
<p>against the muslin. The tiny vibratory messages of life that were</p>
<p>waiting to run across the floor when her bare feet would swing down</p>
<p>to it. Ah, that will to live.</p>
<p>The little runs of life at her from all directions. The cartwright</p>
<p>in his shop next door was already striking sparks off an iron bar.</p>
<p>She could hear the deep-throated sledge hammer. The mystery of the</p>
<p>will to live. The mystery of the cartwright's arm, that could make</p>
<p>the iron boom. And so morning after morning she rose, and wrapped</p>
<p>the gunny sack she wore for an apron into its wad of newspaper, and</p>
<p>trotted off to the agency that seldom failed to have a day's</p>
<p>assignment awaiting her.</p>
<p>Days of rub-a-dub-dub. As if the floor of the universe were an</p>
<p>enormous penny to be scoured and polished, and the emblem on the coin</p>
<p>was the face of the boy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Almost three weeks of the November of that year were so sleet riddled</p>
<p>that the city seemed merely glimpsed through bead portières. Horses</p>
<p>danced on their haunches and smote sparks. Shrubbery was embalmed</p>
<p>under ice, and urban trees stood like fountains whose ornamental</p>
<p>waters had frozen as they curved.</p>
<p>That year the Inverness cape fell literally to pieces like "the one</p>
<p>hoss shay." An uncompromising death. The weave simply would not hold</p>
<p>the thread and the patches fell off in scales. She bought a reefer</p>
<p>at the Sailors' Supply Store. It buttoned about her warmly enough,</p>
<p>but it reached only to her hips and the cold got through to her legs</p>
<p>and, worse than that, the sleeves were too short and too tight and</p>
<p>the armholes cut her. There were always red rims on her flesh where</p>
<p>she had strained through the harsh prison of this reefer, and at the</p>
<p>very first wearing a seam at the shoulder opened in a grin.</p>
<p>Chita's reefer had been like this one, only smaller. It was hard to</p>
<p>disassociate reefers from Chita. Sometimes, buttoning it up, it was</p>
<p>almost as if Chita's eyes popped through the buttonholes with a wink.</p>
<p>A row of Chita's hard, bright, suffering little eyes down the front</p>
<p>of her jacket.</p>
<p>Ah me--Chita----.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lashing its tail, November plunged on. It was pitch dark at six in</p>
<p>the morning and sometimes after their breakfast of tripe-stew and</p>
<p>strong coffee she had literally to take Willy by the wrist and lead</p>
<p>him to his corner. He cried when it was cold, like a child, and</p>
<p>would run along the sidewalks wringing his hands as if they would</p>
<p>fall off, and crying and whimpering with the pain.</p>
<p>Bertha hated him for this. Once he came home with a red welt across</p>
<p>his neck where the boy had stropped him soundly as he came in crying</p>
<p>one day with the cold.</p>
<p>Bertha knew why, exultantly. He hated what she hated. Sniveling,</p>
<p>mewling Willy.</p>
<p>The agency opened at seven. First come, first served. For almost a</p>
<p>week the water froze everywhere in the pipes and there was no work.</p>
<p>One of these days she was put at swabbing out the lobbies and</p>
<p>lavatories of a theater, where the water was hot and plentiful and</p>
<p>plunged out from the faucets in great clouds of steam.</p>
<p>She had never been in a theater. This one was on Broadway near</p>
<p>Twenty-seventh Street, and its lobby was already bombastic with the</p>
<p>sunrise of the cinema. Promises in lithograph. Empyrean ecstasies</p>
<p>in three colors, of girl-cheek to boy-cheek. That swoop of the</p>
<p>senses to a woman's figure with her dilated eyes upside down, as she</p>
<p>hurtled head first off a trestle. A circus for the emotions here,</p>
<p>the human heart their trapeze.</p>
<p>All the forenoon she swabbed the tiled floors, worming with her rag</p>
<p>in between the feet of the little groups that stood before these</p>
<p>posters of escape. Snow-caked shoes. The feet of the city. Gay</p>
<p>feet, old feet, young feet, tired feet. The square little feet of</p>
<p>children and the bulbous feet that had grown lopsided with the</p>
<p>journey. Skulking feet with soft soles and eager feet with kicked</p>
<p>toes. Little girls' feet with tassels and the feet of a crone</p>
<p>wrapped in gunny sacks. Derelict boats. In, out, among those feet</p>
<p>all forenoon. The feet of the seekers after surcease from reality.</p>
<p>After noon an attendant with a festoon of gold braid across his</p>
<p>breast, threw open one of the baize green doors. The feet began to</p>
<p>turn into the theater. Eager pushing feet with little runs to them.</p>
<p>After a while Bertha was sent inside, too. There were lavatories to</p>
<p>be swabbed.</p>
<p>It was dark there and flesh smelling and slanting. To Bertha, as if</p>
<p>she were walking down an incline into the drown of phantom plush.</p>
<p>She floundered and her pail made a ringing noise and that brought her</p>
<p>up suddenly, behind the curtain of a box....</p>
<p>Square gem of light mounted on facets of darkness. A green field</p>
<p>flowing gently toward her, and a child with a handful of flowers</p>
<p>plucked up out of that field turning to smile at her with lips that</p>
<p>the darkness sped up against hers, pucker and all. Silence that</p>
<p>began to throb like the felon that sometimes attacked her third</p>
<p>finger. It was the organ rumbling up into a prelude. A chord came</p>
<p>through like a wave breaking. She slid in. The music of the chimes</p>
<p>goldily--</p>
<p>Then the lettering. It was difficult to follow, because she picked</p>
<p>out the words so slowly, mouthing their bathos aloud. Glitter of</p>
<p>jeweled sands that sped across and ran away.</p>

<p>"Lake Como's Twilights Are Deep Purple."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There on the outside of herself, a twilight the color of her silence.</p>
<p>Grays--with the purple bleeding in. She cried out at its passing----</p>
<p>"Shh-h-h-h----</p>
<p>Mountains next. And after them a magnified view of a rosebud</p>
<p>opening. An intrusion almost, to behold this slim thing bowing with</p>
<p>life. Once petals like that had kissed the very sides of her being.</p>
<p>She began to cry....</p>
<p>Next, a love story. A shoddy sop to reality. A man and a maid</p>
<p>worrying at their emotions like terriers. Scurrying little field</p>
<p>mouse motions that live on chaff.</p>
<p>And yet to Bertha and the rows and rows like her sitting there in the</p>
<p>darkness, it was as if they had been kissed on a bunched-up mouth by</p>
<p>love in a brown velveteen smoking jacket and prettified eyes.</p>
<p>Stinging vicarious sweetness....</p>
<p>Lights. The pale froufrou of shifting audience. Of course--lavatory</p>
<p>floors to be swabbed. The water scurried in little pools before her</p>
<p>brush.</p>
<p>All the way home, while the sleet flew at and bit her, she kept</p>
<p>smiling. "Lake Como's Twilights Are Deep Purple." Herself on the</p>
<p>outside of herself.</p>
<p>At one corner, a taxicab skidded within an inch of pinning her to the</p>
<p>curb. Oaths. A blur of faces, fatty looking with curiosity. A</p>
<p>policeman brushing the water and ice off the flank of her reefer.</p>
<p>The taxicab driver had a zigzag of cut on his face from flying glass.</p>
<p>Red through the glassy fog and he sopped it against his bare hand,</p>
<p>great fellow, and was sick.</p>
<p>She stalked on, big, boxed and smiling, the bulk of her displacing</p>
<p>the dance of the storm.</p>
<p>"Lake Como's Twilights Are Deep Purple." To think of that! The deep</p>
<p>winey purple of her forests.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Banners. Banners. Banners. Streamers of them from roofs and poles.</p>
<p>Little licking tongues of flame curling out. The ripple and snap of</p>
<p>them was a pleasant dazzle. Even the cartwright had a two-penny flag</p>
<p>in his window and a photograph of Roosevelt pasted flat against the</p>
<p>pane.</p>
<p>That was the occasion. The return of Roosevelt from African</p>
<p>adventure. The city fluttered, knife edges of stone softened into</p>
<p>waves by the dance of pennants; the street a fluted alley of them.</p>
<p>Willy, vociferous as ever over his tripe stew, was wild to be off.</p>
<p>"The parade will pass the house. Me and the boy--you watch--we'll be</p>
<p>in the window!"</p>
<p>"Willy--he'll be in the window?"</p>
<p>"Sure. We got broncho caps. I made them. Slk-k-k-k--Roosevelt--he</p>
<p>shoots lions. We'll be watching for him in broncho caps."</p>
<p>He was sly, he was excited, and he jumped up and down again, until he</p>
<p>choked on his coffee and was horrid and she left him there.</p>
<p>It was delicate June in the streets. Pink and blue sky and awnings</p>
<p>with stripes. The bazaar of the city in spring. Bertha was due for</p>
<p>her weekly day's work in a rooming house in West Fortieth Street near</p>
<p>Eighth Avenue. Her feet were so loth. Again and again she dragged</p>
<p>them toward Eighth Avenue, only to turn back and eastward toward</p>
<p>Madison. In two years, with the exception of those days when the</p>
<p>water pipes were frozen, she had not failed a day's assignment.</p>
<p>Flags kept snapping. The air was May wine. The city ran of</p>
<p>excitement. Quickened steps. Pennants. A great man was coming</p>
<p>home. The boy at the window. There would be a boy at the window to</p>
<p>greet him.</p>
<p>The window! Her feet kept trying to walk on resolutely. Seventh</p>
<p>Avenue. Eighth Avenue. Finally, it was no use. She turned back and</p>
<p>began to run a little, with the quickened city. Clumps of people</p>
<p>hurrying and dragging children by the hand. Curbs and balconies and</p>
<p>wagon-tops began to blacken and one truck filled with chairs rattled</p>
<p>by, to shouts and squawking horns.</p>
<p>It was hard not to run. Madison Avenue! The jammed curbs. They</p>
<p>were three deep. And the sidewalk was a little groove between walls</p>
<p>of buildings and of human flesh. The blazing balconies. The</p>
<p>fluttering windows! A window of the house was black. She could not</p>
<p>look. She stood on the opposite curb, and with the tail of her eyes</p>
<p>she knew that a window of the house was black! But she could not</p>
<p>look. For the life of her, the life of her, she could not look.</p>
<p>Blare! A curve of music through the sunlight. Brass. Bright.</p>
<p>Screaming. The street a metal strip. A major domo came over the top</p>
<p>of the hill. Everything ran toward him. The fluttering. The sway</p>
<p>of the crowds. The blowing hair from the heads out of windows. The</p>
<p>shouts.</p>
<p>She stood wedged, her elbows pinned to her hips. The window. She</p>
<p>could not, could not look, but the tail of her eye kept tattling.</p>
<p>There were heads and halves of bodies out of it. Flutterings. One</p>
<p>head was very bright. It caught the light in pools, like the silver</p>
<p>ball of the major domo. She fainted a little standing up there.</p>
<p>Just let go, and the crowd sustained her of its denseness.</p>
<p>The pulse of the living wall that held her--it sang against her--it</p>
<p>wakened her--she leaned out--the major domo was stalking past.</p>
<p>Roosevelt then, standing up in a motor car and flashing and bowing,</p>
<p>with the light on his spectacles and his teeth and his cheek bones.</p>
<p>_There_ was a man who felt the little vibratory messages run in and</p>
<p>flashed them out again, broadcast! He was like a magnet with them</p>
<p>and the nap of the crowd rose up to his passing! Cheers! He stood</p>
<p>as he rode, always smiling, and always with the light on his</p>
<p>spectacles and his teeth and his cheek bones.</p>
<p>Smiling! Bowing! Bowing to the window! Bowing to the window! Her</p>
<p>eyes would not lift, but the tail of her glance kept knowing. The</p>
<p>Colonel bowing to the window. The Colonel and that very bright head</p>
<p>that caught the light in pools.</p>
<p>The crowd began to loosen. A disintegrating snowbank. It was</p>
<p>frightening to feel the support withdraw. The Colonel had passed.</p>
<p>It was easier to move. She was going to look. She had found the</p>
<p>strength to look. It was hard to breathe and to swing her heavy</p>
<p>burning eyes just a little upward--there!</p>
<p>But the heads were withdrawn and someone was jerking down a shade.</p>
<p>The window stared over at her blandly. A slap in the face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>All the little flutterings had run out of the street. The asphalt</p>
<p>flowed in a stiff river up to the peak, over which the major domo had</p>
<p>come up shining. The houses, the brown, proper, hateful houses that</p>
<p>could look so closed, had bowed back into themselves. She kicked in</p>
<p>the impotence of her despair, against the stone trim of one of them,</p>
<p>stubbing her shoes and her toes. It was hard for her to cry. The</p>
<p>sobs came through her throat slowly and inflamed it. But for blocks</p>
<p>she walked weeping them, dryly.</p>
<p>Her boy shining up there in the window. Her boy upon whose face she</p>
<p>had not dared to look.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Willy was building something. The small mousy noises of his boring</p>
<p>seemed suddenly to have destination. Sometimes an hour or two after</p>
<p>she had fallen asleep on her wagon seat behind the curtain, Bertha</p>
<p>would wake up to the sound of hammering. For the first time</p>
<p>Something was taking shape under his tinkerings.</p>
<p>"Willy, what are you making?"</p>
<p>"Slk-k-k-k-k!"</p>
<p>"Huh? Tell me, Willy."</p>
<p>"Slk-k-k-k-k--wouldn't you like to know?"</p>
<p>"What is it, Willy?"</p>
<p>"Puddintame, ask me again and I'll tell you the same."</p>
<p>One evening, however, the object took shape as he puttered at it. A</p>
<p>box with hinges and a little padlock and various little compartments</p>
<p>inside for irregular shaped objects. That same evening as Bertha</p>
<p>rinsed off the dishes and ranged them in their poor array above the</p>
<p>faucet, he painted it a bright green and with a surprising ingenuity</p>
<p>for him, finished off with a large yellow polka dot on the lid. This</p>
<p>dot seemed to punctuate the finality of his achievement. He could</p>
<p>not keep his hands off the box there drying beside the stove,</p>
<p>touching it every few moments for the assurance of drying paint,</p>
<p>going through the ludicrous pantomime of carrying it before him like</p>
<p>a page. In the bit of broken mirror above the faucet Bertha watched</p>
<p>him. Silly Willy.</p>
<p>Suddenly he came up behind her, making the boring sound between his</p>
<p>tongue and cheek that went in through the back of her ear like a</p>
<p>gimlet.</p>
<p>"Slk-k-k-k--a tool box! I made it. Slk-k-k-k. It's for him.</p>
<p>To-morrow is his birthday. I made it."</p>
<p>Birthday. The birthday of the boy! The clang of an ambulance</p>
<p>through the mauve of a dawn. The incredible warm little bulb of a</p>
<p>head in the crook of her arm. The music of the chimes tranced</p>
<p>goldily there on the outside of her. The birthday of the boy.</p>
<p>To-morrow! Why, it must be--yes--the hurrying, hurrying years!</p>
<p>She put on her pancake of a hat with a new and skiddering rose she</p>
<p>had fashioned from a bit of ribbon. There were forty-five cents in</p>
<p>her small black pad of a purse.</p>
<p>It was spring again. The lovely quality to it of a petal to the</p>
<p>cheek. Somewhere through that night as it traveled, buds had dozed</p>
<p>into it, cozily. Even the city could not entirely dissipate that</p>
<p>smell of garden. Faces on stoops, dim lily pads lifted to the</p>
<p>warmth. The thin high clink of water running along gutters.</p>
<p>Children with dry noses. The open doors of shops and the musk smells</p>
<p>of winter pouring out of them. The delicate mist with the lavender</p>
<p>in it smeared with the soft gold of lighted show windows. Show</p>
<p>windows! The blocks and blocks of them. They were beginning to</p>
<p>blink out as Bertha roved them. Flimsy painted toys, with the glue</p>
<p>bleeding out of the jointures and forming scabs. Stale candies in</p>
<p>glass jars and powdered with city grime. Sticks of wood. Lumps of</p>
<p>glucose. The abominable makeshifts of poverty.</p>
<p>Up and down a score of city blocks, not a toy, for ten times the</p>
<p>forty cents in her pad of purse, worthy of the birthday of the boy.</p>
<p>The curve of lavender in the evening; that rill of beauty clinking in</p>
<p>the gutters. Something as tender as these for the birthday of the</p>
<p>boy! She could have cried, and did on the homeward turn.</p>
<p>Willy was asleep. There was a darkish mound of him on his cot, and a</p>
<p>white night flowed in and filled the room with light the pallor of a</p>
<p>bridal veil. That dreadful room, and its green box with the yellow</p>
<p>polka dot drying by the stove. Willy face downward and clutched into</p>
<p>his pillow, with his silly heels up. And yet it could be the color</p>
<p>of moon, that dreadful room. Clear and cool and strewn with bridal</p>
<p>veil. There was a gift for you! To capture that color of moon into</p>
<p>a balloon that might burst with a pop in the heart of the boy.</p>
<p>She sat behind the muslin curtain, her mouth moving for the words</p>
<p>that could bring this frail thought out without shattering it into</p>
<p>the blunt grunting things she could say.</p>
<p>She began to undress, the white of her body climbing up out of the</p>
<p>muslin underthings. Great ox-like pallor. The slow rhythm of her</p>
<p>arms rising and falling. The two enormous and clankless chains of</p>
<p>her hair. The whisper of sliding into the boxy whiteness of the</p>
<p>coarse, clean nightgown. It stood off from her like a little</p>
<p>bathhouse, her calm, spatulate feet moving about under it.</p>
<p>The birthday of the boy! She sat on the edge of her carpetbag,</p>
<p>wrapped in the gray blanket that presently she would spread along the</p>
<p>leather wagon seat and roll herself into. The unbleached muslin</p>
<p>portières on their crazy draw string of twine blew in as if they were</p>
<p>animate and wanted to nudge her. They towered and were alive in the</p>
<p>white darkness and seemed to breathe back at her. The tears in her</p>
<p>heart, like the clink of the clear water in the gutter.</p>
<p>The birthday of the boy! Even Willy could bear him gifts. The pad</p>
<p>of black purse lay on the carpet bag beside her. Hateful symbol of</p>
<p>the shopkeeper's hand crawling down into the glass jars for the</p>
<p>glucose lumps! That was the limit of her purchasing power for the</p>
<p>birthday of the boy! The glucose lumps or the painted gimcracks.</p>
<p>She slid down finally with her cheek to the carpetbag. It had a give</p>
<p>to it that was friendly. Its nap cut softly up into her flesh. The</p>
<p>tears rolled down and made a smell of must, as when she scrubbed too</p>
<p>near a rug. A familiar smell that she dozed into, and cried into</p>
<p>through the doze. It was still the lightish night when she awoke.</p>
<p>There was a red triangle on her wet cheek where a sharp edge had cut</p>
<p>up through the carpetbag. She awoke to the small pain of it, pressed</p>
<p>there by the sharp edge of the concertina in her carpetbag. The</p>
<p>outlandish one with the steamship stamp upon it. Old World.</p>
<p>She fell at the straps of her bag. The concertina! It bulged up at</p>
<p>her there from a background of the lovely ocean of Mrs. Farley's</p>
<p>cast-off evening cloak. Silver ends to it and a silver label</p>
<p>engraved in a Russian phrase:</p>
<p>[Illustration: Russian text]</p>
<p>The little grin of white keys. The waffled sides. They were broken</p>
<p>at the creases, but there were some little fugitive notes. She knew</p>
<p>them. They ran upward as the keys sank down in a little delighted</p>
<p>crescendo. La-dee-da-dee! La-dee-da-dee! She made a cave of her</p>
<p>body over the pretty bleat. It ran up. It ran down. And then there</p>
<p>was a way to skip in the middle that made it seem like a mournful</p>
<p>dawn in a valley and another way to skip at the end that made it seem</p>
<p>very glad. Four beautiful tender little ways to play it.</p>
<p>She fell to polishing the silver label, breathing on it and rubbing</p>
<p>it with an edge of the green chiffon. It was a lovely chore,</p>
<p>polishing, dusting down into the tiny crannies with a broom-straw</p>
<p>wrapped in a bit of tissue paper, and every once in a while, down,</p>
<p>deep, under the cave of her body, greedily away from the ears of</p>
<p>Willy--La-dee-da-dee!</p>
<p>A spring day came up over the roofs. She dressed in its early chill,</p>
<p>her fingers bungling as she buttoned with too much haste.</p>
<p>She came out from behind her muslin portières bearing her gift shyly.</p>
<p>"It bane for the boy--his birthday," she said, and placed the</p>
<p>concertina on the table beside the plate of hominy she had fried and</p>
<p>dished up for him. "My gift."</p>
<p>"Say, say, a little old accordion! That's a good 'un--where'd you</p>
<p>dig that little old accordion up? Say now--Slk-k-k-k--won't he like</p>
<p>that!"</p>
<p>"It bane from me--Willy--he won't know it but--it bane from me----"</p>
<p>"What'll it play? A tune?"</p>
<p>She could not keep her fingers from fluttering over it.</p>
<p>"Don't be rough with it, Willy."</p>
<p>He broke the sinuous fluted case, his head cocked and his eyes in</p>
<p>their corners.</p>
<p>"La--dee--da--dee----</p>
<p>"Say--won't he like that! Me and the boy--we'll give a concert down</p>
<p>in the furnace room--slk-k-k-k."</p>
<p>He could scarcely wait to strut off, the green box and the concertina</p>
<p>crowded under one arm and tipping him lopsided.</p>
<p>He started off, his little pot belly leading and Bertha after him,</p>
<p>until at the corner, under the elevated, their ways parted.</p>
<p>"It bane from me, Willy--he won't know it--but it bane from me."</p>
<p>"Slk-k-k-k----"</p>
<p>It was Saturday, Bertha's day for the kindergarten floors of St.</p>
<p>Rose's Parochial School on Ninth Avenue.</p>
<p>The water ran in wide pools and her arm went in big swoops after it.</p>
<p>There was a rhythm to each stroke.</p>
<p>La-dee-da-dee. La-dee-da-dee.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The house in West Fortieth Street near Eighth Avenue was tall and</p>
<p>thin, and small grill work balconies, mere pretenses, swelled out</p>
<p>slightly from the two first-floor windows.</p>
<p>They were fairly neat windows, with a hideous _jardinière_ containing</p>
<p>cotton palms in each. Day by day they stood there revealing, between</p>
<p>the tiresome lace curtains, the brown and yellows of the bulbous</p>
<p>_jardinières_. The three upper stories were all closely drawn, dark</p>
<p>green shades blotting out the look of dwelling and leaving something</p>
<p>tall and thin, blind and a little sinister.</p>
<p>Every Wednesday morning when she arrived, Bertha was given a pail and</p>
<p>brush and put to washing down the hallways and the four flights of</p>
<p>stairs. A curious odor of lysol and scented soap drifted about in</p>
<p>the stale silence of these corridors, a nub of gaslight burning at</p>
<p>each landing. Sometimes in swabbing the woodwork, a flare of the</p>
<p>dirty scrub water ran under the padded stair-carpet. Then the musty</p>
<p>stench arose.</p>
<p>There was something mysterious about these halls. Occasional women</p>
<p>in kimonos scurried from room to room and laughter and voices</p>
<p>sometimes beat against the closed doors. But for the most part they</p>
<p>stood black and silent and orderly. Sometimes there were big</p>
<p>footsteps ground into the carpets and broken bits of glass, women's</p>
<p>elaborate garters, and evidences of unsavory revelry strewn about the</p>
<p>stairs, but Bertha's day was invariably long and black and narrow.</p>
<p>The four floors of airless hallways to be swept; woodwork to be</p>
<p>washed down; banisters to be rubbed with furniture oil, and the four</p>
<p>red gas globes with warts blown into them to be unscrewed, rinsed in</p>
<p>warm water, and readjusted.</p>
<p>Mrs. McMurtry, who walked without sound, supervised all this. She</p>
<p>was very prim and very slight, and her lips had the thin, unkissed</p>
<p>look of triumphant asceticism. A man's hand could have spanned the</p>
<p>width of her shoulders. She wore keys at her belt, a black alpaca</p>
<p>waist with a standing collar without ruche, so that there was a red</p>
<p>rim around her neck, and when she paid Bertha her two dollars and ten</p>
<p>cents every Wednesday evening, her thin dry fingers high-stepped</p>
<p>gingerly away from too close contact with the currency. She was</p>
<p>about forty and had let that forty come, grayly.</p>
<p>One Wednesday morning someone in the third-floor-back must have been</p>
<p>very ill. There was a sweetish, etheric odor in the house, and Mrs.</p>
<p>McMurtry hurried back and forth with ice packs and blankets. A</p>
<p>narrow black doctor with a narrow black bag oozed up through the</p>
<p>halls. A group of the kimono-clad women gathered at the end of the</p>
<p>hall, bleating like frightened quail. One of them had left her door</p>
<p>open. The room was papered in light red, the drawn shades were</p>
<p>green, and four of the jets on a very ornate center chandelier were</p>
<p>burning. An imitation tapestry of nude Leda and her swan hung over</p>
<p>the mantel. A man was seated on the side of the wide bed, bending to</p>
<p>lace his shoes. Mrs. McMurtry, passing with a bowl of cracked ice,</p>
<p>leaned in to close that door hurriedly. Then she shooed away the</p>
<p>girls. They scattered like doves off of crumbs. One of them,</p>
<p>trailing the edge of her light sateen kimono in the pool of Bertha's</p>
<p>scrub water so that it slapped against her bare legs, glanced down</p>
<p>with a kick and an oath.</p>
<p>It was Helga.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Helga was so thin! And pretty. A delicate, convalescent kind of</p>
<p>prettiness, as if she had been ill a long while, and her hands had</p>
<p>whitened and her skin softened and her eye sockets were like enormous</p>
<p>pans with a jewel in them. This soft-handed Helga whose wrists used</p>
<p>to crack open from chapping and bleed until she cried!</p>
<p>"Helga!"</p>
<p>"Fortheluvvaga! So help me--it's the lump! Bertha!"</p>
<p>Pretty, pretty Helga, with her brown hair frizzed and her face full</p>
<p>of pink light from the sateen kimono. Bertha on her knees, with her</p>
<p>hands dripping the sloppy water, could only sit back on her heels and</p>
<p>stare her fill.</p>
<p>"Helga, you remember me?"</p>
<p>"You're the square head from Farley's. You're the quitter walked off</p>
<p>one breakfast time and left us cold. If it ain't old Berth!"</p>
<p>She began to cry, for all the world like a convalescent too weak to</p>
<p>know quite why.</p>
<p>"It's old Berth--still scrubbing."</p>
<p>"You're so pretty, Helga--that way."</p>
<p>"And you're so white, Berth. Still like a white old tomb, you,</p>
<p>sittin' on the world, listening to it."</p>
<p>"You don't work no more, Helga? You're so fine. Helga--Helga--you</p>
<p>ain't----"</p>
<p>"Yes--I am! Oh I work all right, I work! Come in my room."</p>
<p>"Mrs. McMurtry won't like that!"</p>
<p>"The hell Mrs. McMurtry won't. I don't owe her nothing. She does</p>
<p>all the owing there is around here. I don't owe her nothing. Not</p>
<p>even an apology."</p>
<p>Helga's room was papered in light green and there was an atrocity of</p>
<p>a great green satin bow, sprawled like a spider, pinned on the lace</p>
<p>curtains. The shades were drawn against the relenting spring</p>
<p>sunshine and the gas jets sang. A brass bed and a base burner and a</p>
<p>carpet with an enormous floral wreath crowded up the room. Between</p>
<p>the windows was a full-length repetition of the tapestry of the nude</p>
<p>Leda and her Swan.</p>
<p>It was somehow a horrible room, the kind Willy was fond of looking at</p>
<p>through the lenses in the Fourteenth Street nickelodeons. You half</p>
<p>expected girls in corsets and ruffled panties to be sitting about</p>
<p>smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Helga! Helga!"</p>
<p>"Why not? Whose got the right to stop me, I'd like to know? I've</p>
<p>slung my last pot for the privilege of keeping the slanting roof of</p>
<p>somebody's garret over my head."</p>
<p>"This place----?"</p>
<p>"Yah--yah--what do you think? A convent? Don't look so holy or</p>
<p>you'll sprout a halo. Sit down. Oh, I know all your Sunday school</p>
<p>gab. You're afraid to touch me. Your scrub water has made you clean</p>
<p>and I'm unclean. I know--the line of talk. You're clean with slops</p>
<p>and me I--I'm dirty with stinkin' perfume--you don't need to touch</p>
<p>me----"</p>
<p>"Why Helga--Helga--come here--kiss--me----"</p>
<p>Suddenly Helga began to cry again, the tears of physical weakness.</p>
<p>"I know what I'm doing. Pretty damn well. Where did I get off?</p>
<p>Nobody's ever yet answered me why I had to get up at six, every tooth</p>
<p>in my head rattling of cold and my back aching from a lumpy cot, so</p>
<p>that four hours later a thin-lipped icicle that never done nothing</p>
<p>for this world except get herself born into it right, could step out</p>
<p>of her soft bed into a warm bath and then to her hot breakfast that</p>
<p>three of us had been three hours bustling around in the cold dark</p>
<p>getting ready for her. Not much!"</p>
<p>"How long, Helga, since you quit the Farleys?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't stand the young one! Rollo's wife. There's the one</p>
<p>finished me. I stuck it out two years after she came. There was a</p>
<p>hell-cat for you. The kind of a house-devil that wakes up with her</p>
<p>eyes glued shut and can't straighten herself out into a presentable</p>
<p>creature until along about noon when the society stuff starts to</p>
<p>begin. I know 'em--the smooth-faced kind with the smooth-parted hair</p>
<p>and the pecan-shaped faces. There was a woman could subscribe to a</p>
<p>charity ball with one hand and pinch an orphan with another. She led</p>
<p>me a merry hell for two years I won't soon forget. And Rollo--that</p>
<p>poor piece of white meat! He can thank God he made himself famous</p>
<p>writing a book before she copped him. He'll never write another.</p>
<p>He's married to one that takes all and gives nothing. She couldn't</p>
<p>inspire a man to write an entry in the butcher book."</p>
<p>"Why did you quit, Helga?"</p>
<p>"One month she had the old woman dock me for a little old terra cotta</p>
<p>statue I knocked off of Rollo's desk, dusting it. She said Rollo had</p>
<p>written his greatest poem in front of that little terra cotta on his</p>
<p>desk and that no money could repay it, but she was for learning me a</p>
<p>lesson. I learned her one. There was ten coming to dinner that</p>
<p>night and me on second-floor duty. Well, that dinner party had to</p>
<p>slide out of its fur coats and powder its noses alone that night. I</p>
<p>quit!"</p>
<p>"And this?"</p>
<p>"I got to thinking, that's all. All back doors and slop cans for</p>
<p>some--front doors and canopies for others--no reason--just happening</p>
<p>that way. God couldn't mean it like that. And what if He did? He</p>
<p>was God. I'm me! Little! Weak. I get so tired, Bertha. Nobody</p>
<p>gets so tired as I do. My floatin' kidney. I love to sleep so.</p>
<p>It's a sickness. I can't pull out of it. I ain't strong, Bertha. I</p>
<p>couldn't--I--I ain't strong and white and all on the inside of me</p>
<p>like you! Lye water hurts my hands! Slops stink. It eats my heart</p>
<p>to have to peek through the swinging doors at the good things of life</p>
<p>being gobbled by others that ain't earned 'em as much as we have.</p>
<p>That's why I'm here. I thought maybe--God--I thought maybe----"</p>
<p>"Maybe--what?"</p>
<p>"Maybe some of the easiness--was coming to me. There--there was a</p>
<p>fellow--you remember--while you was at Farley's--Joe Dike, the little</p>
<p>plumber that always used to kid you about sitting and listening to</p>
<p>the oleander tree grow. Joe liked me. I never made no bones,</p>
<p>Bertha. I wanted kids. A two-by-four of my own somewheres and kids.</p>
<p>That's all I ever asked out of it. Joe, he strung me along a while</p>
<p>after you left and then--he quit. It used to go against his grain</p>
<p>not even to be allowed to sit in the kitchen. He had self-respect</p>
<p>Joe did. He didn't like courting in alleyways and elevated trains.</p>
<p>I--didn't have nowheres except to sneak him--up. That's where I lost</p>
<p>my chance, Bertha. Joe liked me while I was straight and used to</p>
<p>talk marrying, but when he seen me up there in that dirty</p>
<p>hole--living like a rat--he--I--aw--after him--I didn't--care--that's</p>
<p>all. I don't care now!"</p>
<p>"I care, Helga."</p>
<p>"You! Lots anybody cares for me. But I fooled 'em. I fooled</p>
<p>'em--I--got a place--now--I--got a place now--to invite 'em in!"</p>
<p>Suddenly Helga, whose prettiness was drawn back from her face as if</p>
<p>someone were pulling her by the hair, fell forward in a pink sateen</p>
<p>huddle against Bertha.</p>
<p>"And now the worst of it is, I hate them, Bertha. Some day I'll kill</p>
<p>one. Their mouths. Their ugly wet mouths. McMurtry sends me the</p>
<p>slobbiest ones. She hates me, because she knows I hate her. They</p>
<p>begin coming as early as six--mouths all loose and wet that slide</p>
<p>around in their faces like something alive crawling over them! I'll</p>
<p>kill one some day! Help me, Bertha. Where can I turn to? Where, oh</p>
<p>God, where?"</p>
<p>Then Mrs. McMurtry came in. A neat little, black little engine</p>
<p>without a puff.</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"I spilt a bottle of medicine and she wiped it up for me."</p>
<p>"Go back to your work, Bertha."</p>
<p>Out in the hallways the twilight was like smoke. It wound and it</p>
<p>thickened and it flowed around the little nubs of light. The waiting</p>
<p>webby water in Bertha's pail lapped on to her wrists as she plunged</p>
<p>them into the pail again. Clung there.</p>
<p>At six o'clock Mrs. McMurtry paid her off. The two one dollar bills</p>
<p>again and the ten cent piece.</p>
<p>"Next Wednesday, Bertha."</p>
<p>"Next Wednesday, Mrs. McMurtry."</p>
<p>Going downstairs she crowded up against the wall to let someone pass.</p>
<p>He had a wet mouth. Like a live thing crawling across his face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sometimes in summer, Willie went away with the family to a square</p>
<p>house by the sea. Bertha knew it well from the picture post card</p>
<p>view of it that he kept tacked up over the table. The edge of the</p>
<p>vast smooth lawn was walled into a fortress, against which the sea</p>
<p>plunged in a fury of spray. A row of imported poplar trees, straight</p>
<p>as young boys, bisected this sleek lawn into an Italian garden on one</p>
<p>side and a cleared area of playground for the boy on the other.</p>
<p>There was a swing with an awning; a small wooden chute-the-chutes,</p>
<p>carefully railed, and by scanning with the eye almost touching the</p>
<p>card, tiny croquet hoops and pegs could be discerned against the</p>
<p>turf, which undulated along, supple as a caterpillar, until the sea</p>
<p>brought it up, sheerly.</p>
<p>There was something terrifying about that rebuffed surf, as It showed</p>
<p>up on the post card, bending back with spray. Terrifying thought of</p>
<p>the boy bounding down that springy sod with the wind in his face and</p>
<p>the thwarted sea full of its licking tongues.</p>
<p>Often at night Bertha awoke trembling with that fear. It helped</p>
<p>somehow to have Willie there with him--and yet--just silly</p>
<p>Willie--and the leaping, grinding, gnashing sea running up to the</p>
<p>feet of the boy.</p>
<p>So the summers could be long, even cruel, except that it was pleasant</p>
<p>to have the muslin portières drawn back and never to feel the</p>
<p>skulking putterings of Willie, or to waken to the grimace which he</p>
<p>loved to hang over her pillow. The room could be very hot. It</p>
<p>seemed to pant at night, as if the long scorching trail of the day</p>
<p>had left it exhausted. Warm breath stole out of its walls. The</p>
<p>leather wagon seat was hot to the touch.</p>
<p>One August evening she dragged the old thing to the window and lay on</p>
<p>it there, where she could lift her face to the sill every little</p>
<p>while in the hope of a fugitive passing breeze. It was horrible.</p>
<p>Babies cried and died in that welter. The bare, tossing little limbs</p>
<p>were sprawled on the stoops and fire escapes. She could rest her</p>
<p>chin upon the sill and look out on the litter of them and on the</p>
<p>mothers whose arms were filled with the hot, sick droop of prostrated</p>
<p>children. The tired senile infants in the thick of their battle with</p>
<p>the tenements. The secret exultancy of Bertha. An exultancy that</p>
<p>could burn in her like wine.</p>
<p>Puling, mewling sons of the mothers whose arms were rich with them.</p>
<p>Bertha's were empty. So empty that sometimes, for the relief of</p>
<p>tangible pain, she would wrap them around her body until the hands</p>
<p>clasped in back, for the ache of the pulling sockets. Those mothers</p>
<p>out there who thought that their arms were rich with the mewling and</p>
<p>puny sons. Bertha's were empty, but her son was in a white square</p>
<p>house by the sea, where the nights blew in life-giving with salt, and</p>
<p>a green lawn flowed all about him, growing and shimmering so that his</p>
<p>swift boy's feet might beat it down. Tormented exultancy of Bertha!</p>
<p>Sometimes Helga came. She was only half a Helga now, so slim, and</p>
<p>the indoor pallor made her very lovely. Until she spoke she was</p>
<p>delicate as an old perfume and then her voice came out of this</p>
<p>frailty with all of its old husky quality. The same berating Helga</p>
<p>who could box an iceman's ears or shrill down Mrs. Farley over the</p>
<p>strewn mass of her slovenly bed.</p>
<p>Her slippers. They were so pretty. Slim with tall heels and buckles</p>
<p>of bronze beads across the instep. Twinkling feet. And a pleated</p>
<p>silk dress with a skirt that opened out in a fan. And there was</p>
<p>money in her purse. You could see the green of the bills through the</p>
<p>gilt mesh. More than once her impulse had been to leave some of</p>
<p>these bills with Bertha.</p>
<p>"I suppose if I was to give you a ten spot, you would sprout a</p>
<p>sanitary halo and tear up the dirty stuff."</p>
<p>"I got enough. Day work is good."</p>
<p>"Yeh,--you got enough. Smoked fish and a horse blanket. Oh, I know.</p>
<p>Even you are too good for prostitute money."</p>
<p>"Even--me----"</p>
<p>They seldom lit the gas. It cost, and besides in the heat it was</p>
<p>unbearable. Sometimes, with the silk dress spread around her in a</p>
<p>great flower, Helga sat on the floor with her cheek against the sill,</p>
<p>her dry feverish face thrust up for a breath of air. Bertha,</p>
<p>barefoot, upright on the soap box that served as the room's second</p>
<p>chair, and a bit back from the window, the dark silence thick and</p>
<p>luxurious to her as sealskin.</p>
<p>"Fortheluvvaga, why don't you say something? You give me the</p>
<p>jimjams. I'd sooner have you say what's on your mind than sit there</p>
<p>like you was sitting up on top of the world brooding over it. Whadda</p>
<p>you keep looking at me like that for? You ought to set yourself in a</p>
<p>gilt frame with some candles burning up to yourself. It's my</p>
<p>funeral--not yours----"</p>
<p>"And mine--Helga--to see it go bad--with--you----"</p>
<p>"I'm nothing to you----"</p>
<p>"Nothing--and everything."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Bertha--who are you----?"</p>
<p>"Yoost--me."</p>
<p>"Well, whoever you are, I won't be saved, if that's what's on your</p>
<p>mind. I know the slick ways of the savers. Words. Words. Words</p>
<p>from the teeth out never saved anybody. I know them. I hate a</p>
<p>professional thin-lipped saver like I hate the ripple in a snake--I</p>
<p>know what I'm doing, I do. Saved for what? Saved for going back to</p>
<p>scrubbing somebody's pots and pans in somebody's kitchen? That's a</p>
<p>helluva life, ain't it, to want to be saved for? You or any of the</p>
<p>professional savers got a swell chance to save me from that."</p>
<p>"That--don't matter----"</p>
<p>"Yeh--yeh--I know! I know! Dishwater don't need to soak through to</p>
<p>the soul. I know the line of talk. Well, it soaks through me!</p>
<p>Makes me sick with the meaning of living. If there's got to be pot</p>
<p>slingers for ladies who breakfast in pink silk boudoirs, then all of</p>
<p>us on the kitchen side of the door ought to have been made with</p>
<p>machinery inside instead of hearts and souls."</p>
<p>"Somebody has got to----"</p>
<p>"Well, that don't make it no easier to be one of the pot-slinging</p>
<p>somebodies. If you've got a heart and a soul, then you're going to</p>
<p>ask questions about what made you one of the somebodies on the</p>
<p>kitchen side of the door, instead of on the pink silk side, and if</p>
<p>you ask questions it's a helluva lot of satisfaction you get.</p>
<p>Somebody's got to sling the pots. That's about all the answer</p>
<p>anybody has been able to give me yet. Oh, it's all right about being</p>
<p>too deep down inside yourself to mind the scum on your hands. Maybe</p>
<p>you can pull a dead rat out of its hole like you was picking a lily,</p>
<p>I've seen you do it, but I'm one of the human ones. I'm glad I done</p>
<p>what I done. I'd do it all over again."</p>
<p>"Helga----"</p>
<p>"I've nothing to be saved for. I've worked in the kitchens of the</p>
<p>good ones and the bad ones and it don't make it any easier. Going</p>
<p>around the alley way for someone whose heart is made no different</p>
<p>than your heart and whose soul wasn't made in a special heaven.</p>
<p>Yeh--I'd do it all over again--and I hate 'em, I tell you--hate</p>
<p>them--I hate them--their wet slippery mouths----"</p>
<p>She fell down into the huddle then of the accordion-pleated silk</p>
<p>skirt, racked with the sobs she had not the strength for, and she had</p>
<p>to be cooed and soothed out of what seemed almost delirium. Cooed</p>
<p>and soothed as if she had been a child. Bertha's.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was raining in a soft, fast whisper. The first September gusts</p>
<p>fanned sprays of it through the open window. A tin spout dribbled.</p>
<p>It was an evening for placing a growing plant on the window sill.</p>
<p>The gusts came stronger and full of rain. Finally the window had to</p>
<p>be lowered and then the fine fizz went after the pane. An evening</p>
<p>with a sense of hurry to it. Pedestrians hurrying with slant</p>
<p>umbrellas. The waiter from Tom's Eating Place across the way,</p>
<p>hurrying into the Crescent Billiard Parlors with a covered tray. And</p>
<p>how the soft rain did hurry. It had a melody. Bertha dried her cup</p>
<p>and plate to it. Sleet--te--tee! Sleettee--tee! Sleeeeeee!</p>
<p>The twilight was a little mouse, and the rain full of tiny scuttling</p>
<p>feet. The old cup and the plate with a V chopped out, shone in a</p>
<p>pale, jagged grin when she set them on the shelf. It was hard to</p>
<p>light the gas because the matches were damp, There!</p>
<p>Someone was coming up the stairs. In clumps. It was Willie, home</p>
<p>from the three months of country. There was the rocking-chair derby,</p>
<p>with a little rill of water dripping from the gutter of the brim, and</p>
<p>a large newspaper bundle of his belongings throwing him a little</p>
<p>lopsided.</p>
<p>"Slk-k-k-k," he said, and stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>She flew at him and took his wet hat and shook it and dragged the</p>
<p>soap box for him up to the stove, so that he sat down in an immediate</p>
<p>exudation of steam.</p>
<p>"Willie--the boy---you bane home again!"</p>
<p>He was sullen and held her off with his elbow.</p>
<p>"Don't shove. Don't shove."</p>
<p>"I won't--the boy?"</p>
<p>"Don't shove----"</p>
<p>She poured him a cup of the still warm coffee and he drank it gulping</p>
<p>and sighing and staring, with the rims of his eyes stretched and</p>
<p>contemplating the red doorway to the stove. There was something</p>
<p>irate and dozy about him, like a man who has been jerked out of a nap.</p>
<p>"Willie--you--the boy?"</p>
<p>He began to swing what was left of the coffee around in the cup. He</p>
<p>made a game of it. Swinging and swirling and then he threw it down</p>
<p>his throat at a gulp.</p>
<p>"Ah"--he said--"Hell."</p>
<p>A dart of fear shot through her.</p>
<p>"Willie--the boy--quick--the boy--my boy?"</p>
<p>She had him by the scruff of his neck, so that he came up loosely</p>
<p>like a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p>"Scat you! Crazy!"</p>
<p>"Willie----"</p>
<p>"Aw let up. I'm out of a job," he said, and sat looking groggily</p>
<p>into the door of the stove.</p>
<p>"Then the boy--all right----?"</p>
<p>"Whadda you mean--all right?--All wrong!"</p>
<p>"Willie----"</p>
<p>"All wrong for me. They're takin' him to Europe to-morrow. For two</p>
<p>years--maybe five. Leaves me flat of a job. All of us. There's a</p>
<p>dirty trick to play on the staff. Not even opening the town house</p>
<p>this year."</p>
<p>"Europe--the boy----"</p>
<p>"Yeh--all of a sudden the staff of us, except the old woman that</p>
<p>learns him his books, gets notice. Could knock us down. Taking him</p>
<p>to Europe to study the piano. Beat that! The boy's a great one for</p>
<p>piddling on the piano. Nobuddy notices it much and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden--Europe. And where does that leave us? Out of a job. And</p>
<p>where do we get off because they're taking him to learn the bloomin'</p>
<p>old piano? That's what a fella gets. Stays after hours to play with</p>
<p>the boy and in the end it's the boy that costs him his job."</p>
<p>"The--boy--plays--the--piano?"</p>
<p>"Naw, he plays the scissors grinder, in case you didn't hear me the</p>
<p>first time I said it. Piano. You get me? Piano."</p>
<p>Suddenly Willie leaped up, the grimace he loved to hang over her</p>
<p>couch on his face. The vicious, drooly, half-wit mask.</p>
<p>"I know! You! You done it! You gave him that damned concertina!</p>
<p>That was the beginning. He never played before then. That got him</p>
<p>started. He couldn't leave off that damned thing. They kept making</p>
<p>him play it for company. Had him down standing on the dinner table</p>
<p>one night at a party, showing him off on that old accordion. Then</p>
<p>they got him a new one, but he wouldn't leave off with the old. The</p>
<p>one that you sent him. That's what got him started to fumbling out</p>
<p>tunes all day on the piano. That dirty concertina. Yours! You lost</p>
<p>me my job, sending it to him, and now you owe me my living for</p>
<p>starting it all with your old concertina!"</p>
<p>"Willie!"</p>
<p>"You! God damn you." He lunged and struck her on the right cheek</p>
<p>bone with a loud cracking sound and then, as the other cheek swung</p>
<p>around from the impact, struck her again on the left, shambled</p>
<p>downstairs and went out.</p>
<p>A little scarlet tear of blood began to trickle down toward the</p>
<p>corner of her mouth. The taste of it was sickish, and the flesh</p>
<p>began to flame up around her eyes. Waving purple flags.</p>
<p>She stood with her lips fallen apart in what might have been a smile.</p>
<p>"You started it all with that damn concertina." Ecstasy of that! It</p>
<p>made it easy not to faint through the waving purple and to walk over</p>
<p>through the muslin curtains and there, from behind the overturned</p>
<p>wagon-top marked in a red star and "R.H. Stacy and Company," to drag</p>
<p>out the old carpetbag and pack it with unfumbling hands.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The rain had ceased. A warmish night was left that was soft as an</p>
<p>oyster and felt clammy to the cheek. The street lights went down in</p>
<p>corkscrews into the sidewalks, and when you glanced up the heavens</p>
<p>were all moving with the hurry of low clouds. And yet the murkiness</p>
<p>parted like a curtain. Bertha's feet were so swift and her face</p>
<p>thrust ahead like a blade cutting. A lovely, draped kind of a night,</p>
<p>through which she could pass to the swish of her own tingling blood.</p>
<p>Street cars clanged angrily and almost touched her as she darted.</p>
<p>The carpetbag hit softly.</p>
<p>The balls of her feet were part of this business of being glad. She</p>
<p>felt big and silly, jiggling along on them. It was hard to keep the</p>
<p>lip down firmly over the teeth. It kept quivering to smile.</p>
<p>Sometimes the street ran in darts of color because of the bonfires</p>
<p>underneath her eyes. Bonfires of exultant flame.</p>
<p>The petty shops and the soiled look of poverty began to peter out.</p>
<p>The tenement badges of fire escape and clothes line, of prowling cats</p>
<p>and strewn gutters, left off suddenly after Lexington Avenue, and by</p>
<p>the hair line of a bisecting street, the respectable brownstone march</p>
<p>began. Blocks of solemn, riveted, stare after stare. The monotony</p>
<p>of the desert, captive in city streets.</p>
<p>In the well-to-do aridity of one of these crosstown blocks, as she</p>
<p>worked her way zigzag toward boarding a car for Front Street, a pair</p>
<p>of women walking ahead turned in at one of the ornate stoops. A</p>
<p>street lamp burned before it and its reflection ran up along the wet</p>
<p>steps in yellow shafts. In this light the quick, avian face of one</p>
<p>of the women spun around upon Bertha and she grasped her companion by</p>
<p>the coat sleeve.</p>
<p>"I tell you, there is a good girl leaving a situation. I know the</p>
<p>look of them. Neat as a pin. There is no harm asking."</p>
<p>The second face was hung on delicately. Like a pear.</p>
<p>"Tilda, how can you? It's not only an insulting thing to do, but in</p>
<p>a city like New York it isn't safe. Come, dear."</p>
<p>"I've picked up some of the best servants I ever had that way. That</p>
<p>is how I found Aggie one Saturday morning, right off the cornet of</p>
<p>Madison and Fifty-first Street. She reminds me something of Aggie,</p>
<p>too. New York or no New York, I know a good servant when I see one.</p>
<p>Say, you--girl----"</p>
<p>"Tilda!"</p>
<p>"Say, you! Come here, please."</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I merely wish to ask, you don't mind, I'm sure, if you are</p>
<p>leaving a situation, or if you happen to know of a good cook or</p>
<p>housemaid, who does want a place?"</p>
<p>"Tilda!"</p>
<p>"Paula, if you don't like it I wish you would go into the house. I</p>
<p>know what I am doing. My daughter thinks it shocking because I stop</p>
<p>you in this fashion. You don't mind, do you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then do you wish a place?"</p>
<p>"Yah----."</p>
<p>"There, didn't I tell you! Thank goodness, I am sufficiently</p>
<p>strong-minded to follow my own intuition and ask for what I want in</p>
<p>this world when I see it. Are you a cook?"</p>
<p>"Tilda dear, if you must have this out, at least take her into the</p>
<p>house and don't air the transaction to the entire neighborhood."</p>
<p>"Don't mind my daughter. You know how young people are about doing</p>
<p>anything a little off the beaten trail. Come into the house. I want</p>
<p>to talk to you. Never mind the servant's entrance, although that's</p>
<p>what I like. A girl who instinctively knows her place. Come up the</p>
<p>front steps with me. I'll talk to you in the front hall."</p>
<p>The front hall was cold, with a wainscoting of white marble and there</p>
<p>was the duenna touch of the black lace of iron grill work across the</p>
<p>door. A cold stately lady of a hall. An alabaster Mercury lunged</p>
<p>off the newel post and thrust up a lighted electric torch. A</p>
<p>Baluchistan rug swayed a little under the feet in a springy turf.</p>
<p>"That's right, Paula, you go upstairs. I can talk much more freely</p>
<p>with you away."</p>
<p>"You always did have and always will have your own way of doing</p>
<p>things, dear," she said and disappeared around a charming curve of</p>
<p>balustrade.</p>
<p>Her mother had the nervous intimacy about her of being always about</p>
<p>to pluck a thread off of someone's collar or to moisten her</p>
<p>handkerchief with her tongue and rub off a streak of soot from some</p>
<p>nose.</p>
<p>She sat Bertha down with a pluck at her collar, on the lower-most</p>
<p>step, plopping herself opposite on a Spanish marble bench.</p>
<p>"Don't mind my children. They get provoked at me because I insist</p>
<p>upon doing things my own way. I said to my daughter as we passed you</p>
<p>at the corner, 'There is a good strong girl for someone. There is</p>
<p>something about her. I can tell a good girl when I see one.'</p>
<p>Ordinarily I keep a laundress four days a week, a cook, a housemaid,</p>
<p>a second girl, and a chauffeur, but since Aggie, the excellent cook</p>
<p>who was with me for years, was obliged to leave, I haven't succeeded</p>
<p>in engaging a staff that satisfies me. But that's one thing about</p>
<p>me, when my staff is incomplete, I can pitch in and take a hand</p>
<p>myself. Are you a good cook?"</p>
<p>"I bane good, plain cook."</p>
<p>"Of course. There never was one who wasn't a good, plain cook, to</p>
<p>hear her tell it. Well, we are four in family, although one of my</p>
<p>children is away most of the time. I have three young lady daughters</p>
<p>and I am perfectly free to say that the girl who gets a place with us</p>
<p>is fortunate. I am extremely active about the house, and I expect my</p>
<p>servants to treat me with the same consideration that I give them.</p>
<p>Do I make myself clear?"</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>"References?"</p>
<p>"Yah--I----"</p>
<p>"Don't take them out. If they contain anything bad you wouldn't show</p>
<p>them to me, and if they are good I can find it all out quickly enough</p>
<p>for myself. You're not a gadabout, are you? I always contend that a</p>
<p>girl's chief interests should lie between her kitchen and her room,</p>
<p>just as a business man's lie between his office and his home. Simple</p>
<p>pleasures now and then if she will, but I give my girls nice dry</p>
<p>rooms and I expect them to appreciate them enough to avail</p>
<p>themselves. Now I am willing to give you a trial if you are willing</p>
<p>to try us. I pay forty dollars and expect my money's worth. Yes?"</p>
<p>"Why--yah----"</p>
<p>"You see, I do not even ask you why you are leaving a position at</p>
<p>this hour of the night. I depend solely upon my own judgments. I</p>
<p>like your looks. What are you? German? Scandinavian? Pole? No?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't matter, you seem to be a little of everything. That</p>
<p>isn't a black eye you are getting, is it? Well, that doesn't matter,</p>
<p>either. I hope you haven't any kind of vermin or any bad habits.</p>
<p>But if you have I will find them out quickly enough for myself. You</p>
<p>look spick and span enough to suit me. I have my breakfast at</p>
<p>eight-thirty. Downstairs. I'll come up and awake you at six. This</p>
<p>way, please, and I'll show you up the rear stairs to your room.</p>
<p>Don't bump your head on that slanting ceiling. I take one sliced</p>
<p>orange, two three-minute eggs, two strips of crisp bacon, two level</p>
<p>tablespoons of coffee to the cup, three slices of dry toast for</p>
<p>breakfast. My girls have coffee and toast in their rooms. I have no</p>
<p>waitress or second girl at present, but help from the agency comes in</p>
<p>by the day. Nuisance. Don't bump your head on that slanting</p>
<p>ceiling. Have you a friend--your type of girl, who wants an</p>
<p>excellent position as waitress? I would be willing to engage her at</p>
<p>once."</p>
<p>"Yah--maybe----"</p>
<p>"Here you are. I don't say my servants' quarters are palatial, but</p>
<p>this much I can say for them. They are dry."</p>
<p>"I have a friend, maybe. Helga. Not right away but maybe some day."</p>
<p>"That is good, but first we shall see how we get along. Put your</p>
<p>things down there. As my grandfather used to say of his stables,</p>
<p>good dry floors, fresh water trough, add a little fodder to that, and</p>
<p>no man or beast could ask more! No, don't look around for an alarm</p>
<p>clock, if that's what you're after. I am the alarm clock in this</p>
<p>family. There is your bed. Lie on it."</p>
<p>Such was Bertha's initiation into the house of Mathilda Oessetrich.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the tempo as much as anything else that tired you so. The</p>
<p>household ran. Upstairs. Downstairs. From room to room. And even</p>
<p>from kitchen to dining room, when there was no waitress, and usually</p>
<p>there was none. Bertha ran, too, slapping her way breathlessly</p>
<p>through the swinging doors, dishing up the foods with her tongue</p>
<p>caught between her teeth and her spoons flashing.</p>
<p>The reason was that Mathilde Oessetrich ran. She was heavy, but she</p>
<p>ran upstairs like some one playing an arpeggio scale. She brushed</p>
<p>her thin electric hair in a series of such rapid strokes that it</p>
<p>stood off her head in spikes. She drained her coffee cup in three</p>
<p>firm gulps, and with one gesture plunged into her gloves down to</p>
<p>their very finger tips.</p>
<p>There was no way to live under the roof with Mathilde Oessetrich and</p>
<p>not feel this shimmer of her haste. Her second daughter, Ermangarde,</p>
<p>was nervous with it. Olga, who attended a school for social research</p>
<p>and wore her hair short in the days when it was referred to as</p>
<p>"docked," lived away from the strain of it in a studio in East</p>
<p>Seventeenth Street.</p>
<p>Paula was meekest under it, probably because it had defeated her</p>
<p>first. But even Paula, who at twenty-five had the pale silk hair of</p>
<p>a baby and a pear-shaped face that dipped down over a swan-like neck</p>
<p>after the fashion of Fra Lippo Lippi's ladies, had her retreat from</p>
<p>it. The large, fourth-floor-front room adjoining Bertha's little</p>
<p>cubicle. There was a grand piano in there. For hours, sometimes for</p>
<p>days at a time, Paula would disappear into this retreat, the incense</p>
<p>of her tender, lovely, ruminating music stealing out through the</p>
<p>crack under the door. She played Schubert like a heart-ache and sang</p>
<p>his tender lieder under her breath. Her playing beat softly against</p>
<p>the wall of Bertha's cubicle. Schubert. The dithyrambic brilliancy</p>
<p>of Liszt. Chopin, that could seem to make out of that lathed and</p>
<p>plastered wall between Bertha and Paula at her piano, a fan bowing</p>
<p>softly in the darkness. Sometimes Paula could seem, at her piano, a</p>
<p>little mad. The glints, that were like steel spears, a vertical one</p>
<p>in each of her eyes, must have made her play that way. D'Indy. "Eye</p>
<p>of newt and toe of frog ... like a hell-broth boil and bubble." And</p>
<p>Debussy--lanterns the shape of gargoyles, swung on poles, nosing</p>
<p>among the stars.... The sweet forest where Goland discovers</p>
<p>Mesilande....</p>
<p>Waving tonal wall, between Bertha huddled there on her bed and Paula,</p>
<p>with the vertical spears in her eyes.</p>
<p>There was a day's end for you. Evening after evening of Paula on her</p>
<p>side of the wall. The wall that could sway like a lantern, or bow</p>
<p>like a fan....</p>
<p>It made the days themselves easier. You ran all morning, chiefly</p>
<p>because Mrs. Oessetrich ran behind you. Calling you off of one</p>
<p>half-completed task to begin another and creating in the great square</p>
<p>kitchen an uproar of slamming doors, rattling tins, and the thin high</p>
<p>clatter of her constant voice.</p>
<p>"_Get me the brown sugar, Bertha. I am going to make some of my</p>
<p>panocha for the suffrage bazaar. What's that? Never let me see a</p>
<p>spot of rust on the aluminum pots. That's one thing I am particular</p>
<p>about. That girl does not eat enough to keep a bird alive. Here</p>
<p>you, little delivery boy, never walk into anyone's kitchen in muddy</p>
<p>boots. That's a certain sign of a slovenly character. If Miss Olga</p>
<p>comes this afternoon, Bertha, while I am out, tell her that I expect</p>
<p>her to be here for eight o'clock dinner ta-night when her Aunt Mary</p>
<p>and her godfather Oessetrich are here. My brother-in-law likes his</p>
<p>sauce to leg-of-lamb very minty. I won't have her ignore the family</p>
<p>in this fashion. She is already sufficiently out of favor with her</p>
<p>godfather as it is, on account of her extreme ideas. Oh dear, not</p>
<p>that way. You must beat egg whites as if you meant it. Elbow</p>
<p>grease! Oh dear, run up in the library, Bertha, and see if I left my</p>
<p>glasses on the desk. Is that Miss Ermangarde going out? Run up and</p>
<p>bring me that small bag on my dressing table. I want her to exchange</p>
<p>those tan walking gloves at Alberts. Quick. And, Bertha, tell Eddie</p>
<p>I want the sedan here in an hour and that Miss Olga will use the big</p>
<p>car this afternoon to take some of the girls from her vocational</p>
<p>guidance class out for a drive. I don't know how a boy who thinks as</p>
<p>slowly as Eddie does, can make a successful chauffeur. Hand me the</p>
<p>telephone book, first, Bertha, I want to look up that caterer on</p>
<p>Madison and Fifty-second--her godfather Oessetrich likes pistachio._"</p>
<p>The afternoons were easier. In the sedan with the haggled Eddie at</p>
<p>the wheel she shopped and visited, matched up samples of silk, sought</p>
<p>out seamstresses, interviewed at the employment agencies, sat on</p>
<p>hospital and suffrage boards, stormed in upon Olga's aloofness in the</p>
<p>Seventeenth Street studio, and about every hour found out a telephone</p>
<p>to jangle up the silence she had left behind her.</p>
<p>"_Hello--Bertha, that you? I forgot to lock the linen closet. Do</p>
<p>it. If Madam Gerbhardt calls up, tell her I have an extra seat for</p>
<p>her for 'William Tell' to-night. 'Bye._"</p>
<p>An hour later:</p>
<p>"_Hello, Bertha, that you? Anybody call? Who? Miss Ermangarde?</p>
<p>She what? Won't be home until six. Well? If she calls again,</p>
<p>Bertha, tell her that I do not want her spending her afternoons down</p>
<p>in that Greenwich Village atmosphere and that I expect her to come</p>
<p>directly home from her drawing lesson. Fix caper sauce with the</p>
<p>fish. 'Bye._"</p>
<p>That was how the days flew before her. Shooed like a flapping flock</p>
<p>of tormented hens.</p>
<p>Sometimes Ermangarde exploded into little crying rages that made her</p>
<p>very flushed and appealing. She was nineteen, thickly built, but</p>
<p>with a square kind of Teutonic prettiness. Thin, badly arranged</p>
<p>hair, but her gray eyes made extremely peculiar and intent by a</p>
<p>fringe of thick black lashes. Under stress the pupils swam out into</p>
<p>fine black areas.</p>
<p>"Mother, Mother, Mother," she cried one Sunday evening, jumping up</p>
<p>from the tea table just as Bertha was trying to pass the lemon and</p>
<p>the waffles in two directions at the same time. "Don't direct Bertha</p>
<p>to pass fifty things at once. It's not humanly possible to bend six</p>
<p>ways, even to your will. Don't! Don't!"</p>
<p>"Hear, hear." said Olga from where she sat cross-kneed and a bit back</p>
<p>from the table, waving her cigarette in its long meerschaum holder</p>
<p>and watching the smoke from under almost closed eyes. She had the</p>
<p>same Oessetrich squareness, enhanced by the Hans Memling medieval</p>
<p>look to her hair, the good gray eyes, the skin inclined to be muddy,</p>
<p>and she wore tweeds, thick, expensive, and unbecoming, and a stiff</p>
<p>white shirtwaist with cuffs which made the expression of her hands</p>
<p>broad and masculine. The nails were unmanicured, but clean and</p>
<p>square, as if they had been pared with a knife.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all very well for you, Olga. You live away from the strain</p>
<p>of trying to keep up with Mother. I notice it became too much for</p>
<p>you! The pretext of your nearness to the School of Philanthropy</p>
<p>doesn't deceive anybody. Stop driving us, Mother. Stop expecting</p>
<p>the rest of us to keep up with you. Stop, dearest, stop!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich popped one of the little German _simpfkuchen_ which</p>
<p>graced these Sunday evening tea times whole into her mouth and washed</p>
<p>it down with a generous gulp of strong black coffee. She was crisp</p>
<p>and entirely unassailed.</p>
<p>"Sit down and finish your meal. Eat some of those stewed apples.</p>
<p>They are good for you. And, Bertha, always see to it that Miss</p>
<p>Ermangarde has her bottle of tonic on her breakfast tray. Sit down,</p>
<p>Ermangarde, you are getting pimply."</p>
<p>At that, of course, an entirely crushed Ermangarde left the table,</p>
<p>crying bitterly down into her hands, Paula, whose long pale face was</p>
<p>always thrust forward like a flower eager for dew, turning after her.</p>
<p>"Mother, how could you? What a horrible kind of ridicule, and you</p>
<p>know what a nervous state she is in!"</p>
<p>"Exactly. Self-pity is at the bottom of most neurasthenia."</p>
<p>"Oh--oh, why is it that the members of a family feel privileged to</p>
<p>treat one another with a cruelty they would not exhibit to the merest</p>
<p>stranger?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense," said Olga, reaching forward to knock off her cigarette</p>
<p>ash and leaning back to watch the smoke. "Napoleon was very clever</p>
<p>in the way she handled that case of nerves."</p>
<p>"Yes, Olga, it is easy enough for you to encourage Mother in her</p>
<p>high-handedness, and call her Napoleon, now that you have up and</p>
<p>cleared out. You forget that you used to be the nervous wreck of the</p>
<p>household before you up and took the bull by the horns. It is a</p>
<p>simple enough matter for you to drop in once a week from Seventeenth</p>
<p>Street and view the situation with amused tolerance. But you know</p>
<p>Mother as well as we do. You know that no one in this household is</p>
<p>entitled to a will of her own except Mother."</p>
<p>"My dear Paula, you talk as if will power were a gift, like music or</p>
<p>painting. Will power can be developed like muscle."</p>
<p>"Oh no. Your will power, Mother, isn't normal any more than a</p>
<p>giant's muscle is normal. Yours is crushing. You--you've crushed me</p>
<p>with it. Crushed me with it as surely as if you had steam rolled me.</p>
<p>You crushed me with it the day you let--Harrison walk out of this</p>
<p>room----"</p>
<p>"Now, Paula----"</p>
<p>"You did. You did!"</p>
<p>There was something so stricken about Paula. She was as white as a</p>
<p>handkerchief left lying beside waters that were being dragged.</p>
<p>"Paula," said Olga, who had risen, white too, "if you want to make me</p>
<p>physically ill, then go into that all over again."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Olga."</p>
<p>"You poor weak child of mine. Is it possible you don't see yet that</p>
<p>what I did for you was----"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mother. Please. No more. I--only that question of will</p>
<p>power coming up. I--I know so cruelly what--oh, what is the use of</p>
<p>deceiving ourselves? Mother, this young fellow Wells who is coming</p>
<p>here to see Ermie--you're not interfering there already?"</p>
<p>"The idea! As if one could even take him seriously."</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake, Paula, stop dramatizing an incident. The bare</p>
<p>fact of the matter is that Ermangarde indulges in a nervous chill</p>
<p>because the mater asks a big husky girl to pass the lemon and the</p>
<p>waffles at the same time. You--Bertha--your shoulders are pretty</p>
<p>broad, aren't they? I've an idea that you understand General</p>
<p>Napoleon pretty well."</p>
<p>"Yah, Miss Olga."</p>
<p>"Bertha is a good girl. A bit slow but a good listener. There is an</p>
<p>old German saying my father used to be fond of. It translates</p>
<p>something like this. 'He was strange with the wisdom of his ear to</p>
<p>the ground.' That reminds me of Bertha. Bring in some hot waffles,</p>
<p>please."</p>
<p>Paula's pale face, with the brow shaped like the upper bulge of a</p>
<p>pear and the thinning but pretty hair drawn so tiredly from it, was</p>
<p>still quivering and there was a beating vein in her temple.</p>
<p>"Olga, while you are here, won't you talk to Mother about this</p>
<p>servant situation? It is impossible for one girl to carry the work</p>
<p>of this household with only the wretched assistance of day help."</p>
<p>"Well, Paula, Mother hasn't been able to keep help in the twenty-five</p>
<p>years I've known her. What is the idea of unearthing the family</p>
<p>skeleton at this time?"</p>
<p>"Shh-h-h, Bertha doesn't need to hear this discussion. I remind</p>
<p>myself of the English government. I let my children talk revolution</p>
<p>from their soap boxes to their heart's content and in the din of</p>
<p>their mere words I sit back and run my sane and conservative</p>
<p>household."</p>
<p>"Paula is right, 'Tilda, either you ought to give up the house</p>
<p>entirely and go to a hotel like the Savoy or the Plaza, or learn to</p>
<p>curb your personality sufficiently to make it endurable here for the</p>
<p>average servant."</p>
<p>"Bertha is a jewel, but she is the only one we ever had who could</p>
<p>sort of seem to rise superior to Mother's domination."</p>
<p>"What is she, anyway? A Pole or a Swede? Sort of a Sacred Cow from</p>
<p>the look of her."</p>
<p>"She'd have to be, to be able to endure it here."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, she is a great serene peasant girl with that slow kind of</p>
<p>strength that makes an invaluable servant. She is one in a million.</p>
<p>I'll wager she is the only servant in New York in cotton stockings</p>
<p>to-day."</p>
<p>"I tell you, Olga, 'Tilda is so strong herself she doesn't realize</p>
<p>it, but it isn't fair to expect this household to run along with one</p>
<p>servant."</p>
<p>"One servant. What is the matter with you? I do the work of five."</p>
<p>"Exactly. That is what makes a driving machine out of you. The</p>
<p>average servant won't and doesn't have to stand being driven. There</p>
<p>is another side to the servant question, you know. Silk stockings!</p>
<p>Isn't it sufficient that they have to wash our pots and pans for</p>
<p>us--carry slops--are we to begrudge them even the silk stockings of</p>
<p>life!"</p>
<p>"Hear. Hear."</p>
<p>"The average servant, Mother, won't----"</p>
<p>"Oh, tush, tush, with the average servant. The average servant</p>
<p>doesn't interest me. I am not an average person."</p>
<p>"But Mother, we are average girls! Can't you see the cruel sapping</p>
<p>thing that life in this house has come to mean? Father--frankly ran</p>
<p>away from it----"</p>
<p>"There is neither taste nor justice in that remark."</p>
<p>"Olga has left."</p>
<p>"School of Philanthropy----"</p>
<p>"I find what retreat I can--since--since--Harrison----"</p>
<p>"Paula!"</p>
<p>"And now--little Ermangarde! Don't blame her for running down to</p>
<p>what you call the 'Isms' of Greenwich Village, Mother. Don't blame</p>
<p>any of us for--retreating. You're a general, Mother--Olga's right--a</p>
<p>Napoleon--we're only----"</p>
<p>"I am what is best for you all, only you don't know it. Thank God,</p>
<p>though, my skin is thick."</p>
<p>"But to get back to the subject, Mother. It is unendurable that a</p>
<p>home, I mean a house, like this must be run without servants, because</p>
<p>of your tyrannies."</p>
<p>"What is the matter with you? Hasn't Bertha been promising us a</p>
<p>house girl for sometime past? That Helga, a friend of hers."</p>
<p>"Why, we need at least five servants, Mother. We cannot even keep a</p>
<p>butler. You know that yourself, Olga. You know how you used to</p>
<p>storm every time a butler or a parlor maid left. Well, Mother hasn't</p>
<p>had but one servant in this big barn of a house all the months and</p>
<p>months that Bertha has been here...."</p>
<p>"You can't change a leopard's spots, Paula."</p>
<p>"Well, you girls must confess that this dreadful leopard mother of</p>
<p>yours is always willing to go on the dissecting table, for her family</p>
<p>to further discuss the immutability of those spots."</p>
<p>"Your spots are too like Mother's, Olga. That's why you've--escaped,</p>
<p>I guess."</p>
<p>"Nonsense. My rights are merely the inalienable rights of the</p>
<p>eldest."</p>
<p>"Then, in heaven's name, what are just the inalienable rights of</p>
<p>being just a daughter? A Terrible Meek--like me."</p>
<p>"Submission, my darling, is the terrible lot of the meek."</p>
<p>"Or disaster...."</p>
<p>"Oh, God," chanted Olga, extending her legs and yawning with a</p>
<p>crackle of mannish shirtwaist, "deliver us from the evil of those who</p>
<p>have our welfare at heart."</p>
<p>"He has delivered you," said Paula and regarded her sister with eyes</p>
<p>that were a little humorous and enormously tired.</p>
<p>"Come, come," cried Mrs. Oessetrich jumping up, "something tells me</p>
<p>there is a hiss behind all this patter. I have tickets for Professor</p>
<p>Hartwisch of Brooklyn Institute on Bismarck the Man and Myth."</p>
<p>"But, Mother, I loathe Hartwisch."</p>
<p>"Nonsense. Bertha, run upstairs and help Miss Paula with her wraps</p>
<p>and tell Miss Ermangarde that my masseuse will be here at eight</p>
<p>o'clock to give her a treatment for those pains in her shoulders. If</p>
<p>Mr. Taggart telephones while I am gone, tell him I will be in his</p>
<p>office at nine o'clock to-morrow morning on the matter of those</p>
<p>mortgages. Hurry, Paula, Hartwisch begins at eight. Bertha, oh</p>
<p>Bertha--dear me, what dull ears--Bertha, bring me down my moleskin</p>
<p>cape. She's a good listener, but I have come to the conclusion that</p>
<p>she only hears what she wants to hear."</p>
<p>"That's why you have been able to hold on to her all this time,</p>
<p>Tilda."</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich cast quick, bird-like, and adoring eyes upon her</p>
<p>eldest.</p>
<p>"You're impertinent, darling," she said.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yes, that was the secret. To inure oneself to Mathilda Oessetrich</p>
<p>until she was like a great old tower bell ringing out over a moor</p>
<p>that had not even a parish to summon.</p>
<p>Ding. Dong. The words beat up against Bertha so dimly. For years</p>
<p>she was to move through the tinny clatter of them, _ding, dong,_</p>
<p>around her head in a flock of dissonances.</p>
<p>Butlers and parlor maids simply would not remain. Agencies were</p>
<p>indefatigable and newspaper advertisements brought scant response.</p>
<p>It was as if some invisible symbol of a chalk mark were against the</p>
<p>Oessetrich portals. But there were always the fugitive day helpers,</p>
<p>and in a way Bertha preferred it so. It left her the sovereignty of</p>
<p>the servants' quarters, and the lovely evenings that Paula wove along</p>
<p>the keys. These evenings made the days seem merely like briary</p>
<p>little paths down which one must run to meet them. Cool dim gardens</p>
<p>of Paula's music. Schumann. Schubert. Brahms. Mozart. Paula</p>
<p>played Mozart as if the keys were little wounds that bled. Lyric</p>
<p>exaltation--morose mysticism of Richard Strauss. Salome. Electra.</p>
<p>Monstrous flowers of fancy. Conflagration of discord. Fiery</p>
<p>particles. Boiling darkness. Then again, so tenderly that it was</p>
<p>hard to bear, lacy loveliness of Chopin. Beethoven. Appassionata</p>
<p>Sonata.</p>
<p>Booming names that Bertha had never even heard. Deathless masters of</p>
<p>the deathless tonal torrents. Deathless masters--but one of them had</p>
<p>strolled with the girl with the flax-colored braids like Bertha's,</p>
<p>across the plushy meadow and at dawn had lain singing to her the</p>
<p>troubled wisps of melody that were not quite born. The wisps of old</p>
<p>sound....</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Dudley Wells was the wavy-looking young man who was coming to visit</p>
<p>Ermangarde, wavy because his clothes seemed always too large for his</p>
<p>nervously slender body. He seemed to shrink from contact with them,</p>
<p>so that his trousers ran in little ripples along his legs and air</p>
<p>currents got somehow up under the back of his coat and flapped it</p>
<p>mildly.</p>
<p>He wrote poetry that looked on the page like the first footsteps</p>
<p>abroad in a snowstorm and edited a slender sporadic magazine that was</p>
<p>printed on arty deckle-edge, butcher's paper.</p>
<p>_The Whisk Broom_</p>
<p>Published Every Once in a While.</p>
<p>The two collections of his poetry which Ermangarde kept jealously on</p>
<p>her own desk were thin, too, ascetically bound in cardboard, and with</p>
<p>the verse stepping in a stark sort of straggle down the page. One of</p>
<p>them had its back broken from frequent opening to the same page; a</p>
<p>strange page, with words gleaming as if a lapidary had tossed them</p>
<p>willy nilly.</p>
<p>There was a copy of _The Cathedral Under the Sea_ on that desk, too.</p>
<p>It lay there so casually, sometimes open and face downward. It could</p>
<p>throb through the dust cloth. The slender volumes, one titled</p>
<p>"Lanterns" and the other "Sal Atticum," were very thumbed and even</p>
<p>wept upon.</p>
<p>Ermangarde and her titillating secret! Dainty little hours of</p>
<p>sipping into these books like a bird on the brink of a pool, but she</p>
<p>would thrust them beneath a cushion if Bertha came in to dust, or she</p>
<p>heard her mother's footsteps, and on the evenings that Wells came to</p>
<p>sit stiffly beside her, on the pale brocaded couch in the enormously</p>
<p>gold and brocaded drawing-room, the pink would come out in her face</p>
<p>hours beforehand, quite effacing the muddiness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich trod the delicate lay of the land between Ermangarde</p>
<p>and the none too intrepid Wells, with spiked and characteristic boots.</p>
<p>Ermangarde, a frightened child at the frailty of the lovely thing</p>
<p>that was newly hers, cried, and tried to stave her off.</p>
<p>"Mother, if you would only leave us be! Don't come tramping into the</p>
<p>drawing-room on us that way, vivisecting him with your lorgnettes and</p>
<p>calling him 'young man.' He's too sensitive. The things you say,</p>
<p>'Tilda, they make the room shiver, as if--as if a truck were rushing</p>
<p>through. It's not so much what you actually say, but the way you say</p>
<p>it, dear. So matter-of-factly. I--we--he isn't interested in your</p>
<p>Ethical Membership Drive or your Single Tax theories. At least,</p>
<p>dear, not when you tramp in on us--that way. So terribly</p>
<p>matter-of-fact that somehow--oh, I can't analyze it--but it makes us</p>
<p>feel ridiculous--futile--just sitting there. Mother, won't you</p>
<p>please not make us feel so----"</p>
<p>"So what? Pish. I hate mooning. It's servant-girly and</p>
<p>park-benchy."</p>
<p>"Mother!"</p>
<p>"Never did it in my life. That's one thing I can say for your sister</p>
<p>Olga. Faults aplenty, but a matter-of-fact head on her shoulders."</p>
<p>"But----"</p>
<p>"Marry, if you must, when the proper man comes along. Nature is sly</p>
<p>and catches most of us in the end, but don't piddle! Don't waste</p>
<p>time on that absurd game of falling in love with love!"</p>
<p>"Mother----"</p>
<p>"I hate puppy love. It nauseates me."</p>
<p>"Dudley and I----"</p>
<p>"Dudley. Is that his name? His name _would_ be Dudley."</p>
<p>"It is too bad to have to inform you, dear, that you are speaking of</p>
<p>one of the foremost poets of the younger school."</p>
<p>"What school? Kindergarten?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mother, you are the cruelest woman I ever knew. You've a way of</p>
<p>making everything seem absurd. You--you could make Confucius seem</p>
<p>ridiculous."</p>
<p>"He is."</p>
<p>"If you must know it, Dudley is the only human being I have ever</p>
<p>known who--who--has shown me the way out of the hard crust of myself</p>
<p>into--into--beauty--I--if I have the courage to use a sheer word like</p>
<p>'beauty' before you."</p>
<p>"You use the word 'beauty' like the child you are."</p>
<p>"You don't know any kind of beauty, Mother, except the beauty you can</p>
<p>see with your mind. You're all mental."</p>
<p>"Thank God."</p>
<p>"You have never felt the sweep and surge of----"</p>
<p>"You are so callow that it is positively embarrassing to have to see</p>
<p>it happening."</p>
<p>"I----"</p>
<p>"Very well, let your pale-faced poet with adenoids sweep you and</p>
<p>surge you and see where it will land you----"</p>
<p>"Mother!"</p>
<p>"You say he edits the _Dust Broom_."</p>
<p>"The _Whisk Broom_, Mother, you know it isn't the _Dust Broom_."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, the _Whisk Broom_, of course. Well, you let one</p>
<p>of those ninety-pound fangle-dangle poets around Greenwich Village do</p>
<p>your sweeping and surging with his whisk broom and----."</p>
<p>"Mother, I know it is impossible to get the better of an argument</p>
<p>with you. Only don't ridicule us, dear. Dudley is so--so sensitive.</p>
<p>Don't make us feel silly and immature and drifting just because you</p>
<p>are so sure and level-headed and both your feet so firmly planted on</p>
<p>the ground. Let Dudley become more accustomed to us, Mother.</p>
<p>I--Mother, you see, Dudley, he's nothing but a boy, dear, a sensitive</p>
<p>boy--too sensitive to withstand your blasting kind of ridicule--if</p>
<p>you could be a little understanding with him--with us,</p>
<p>dear--Mother--don't drive off Dudley!"</p>
<p>"Well, if an old woman like me can drive off a suitor----"</p>
<p>"You can, Mother. Don't make me hark back to--to Paula and Harrison</p>
<p>again--but if it happened with a big, hale fellow like</p>
<p>Harrison--why--why everything about Dudley, Mother, is too sensitive</p>
<p>not to wither under your methods. Even his feelings for me. They</p>
<p>would be the first to go. Not because he wanted it that way--but</p>
<p>they would wither, dear. He will start by dreading you and then</p>
<p>dreading me because I am your--'Tilda dear--can't I make you see just</p>
<p>a little, the delicate fiber of a boy like Dudley?"</p>
<p>"I understand too much as it is."</p>
<p>"No. You can't. You don't. That's what frightens me so. You</p>
<p>can't. Why even Bertha--that great, white peasant girl out there in</p>
<p>your kitchen--why there--there is something about her comes nearer to</p>
<p>understanding the frail, delicate, tremendous little trifles about</p>
<p>life--than you, Mother--really."</p>
<p>"My two feet are on the ground."</p>
<p>"So terribly on the ground."</p>
<p>"Get out and interest yourself in things that matter. Suffrage.</p>
<p>Social work, like your sister. What about that course in economics</p>
<p>that I even agreed to take with you at Columbia?"</p>
<p>"I loathe economics...."</p>
<p>"Well, you expect your share of a big fortune some day, don't you?</p>
<p>If you do, learn how to take care of it first. Learn the history of</p>
<p>coffee before you inherit your coffee plantations, learn----"</p>
<p>"Coffee doesn't interest me, Mother, any more than----"</p>
<p>"It doesn't? Well then, trust that Whisk Broom fellow to take care</p>
<p>of you in the manner to which you have been accustomed. If you two</p>
<p>young people are really serious, stop mooning and go off and get</p>
<p>married and start on your own."</p>
<p>"Mother, you know we can't do that for a little while, anyway.</p>
<p>Dudley isn't a money maker. He wouldn't be himself if he were.</p>
<p>Mother, you--you've so much. So enormously much. That is one of the</p>
<p>sublime uses of money. To make it easy and possible for genius like</p>
<p>Dudley's to grow and expand. Mother--if you would!"</p>
<p>"Would what?"</p>
<p>"Would--I--somehow, I--we girls--not one of us, Mother, has worked</p>
<p>out her life very happily, yet. Olga is only insulating herself with</p>
<p>her bizarre way of living. Poor--poor Paula--and----"</p>
<p>"Paula!"</p>
<p>"Oh I'm not saying that Harrison was the man for her in the worldly</p>
<p>sense of the word any more than--than perhaps Dudley is for me---but</p>
<p>since--but since it happened that way with Paula--I--sometimes I fear</p>
<p>for Paula, Mother. Her eyes. They can look so big and glassy after</p>
<p>she's been locked up there for days and days playing to herself.</p>
<p>I--Mother, we are none of us happy girls. Wouldn't it be almost like</p>
<p>a symbol of the turning of the tide for all of us if Dudley and</p>
<p>I--well--it--Dudley's proud, Mother. We would have to do it so</p>
<p>delicately. As if he were granting us the privilege. And that's</p>
<p>what it is--isn't it--to make the creation of beauty possible? I--if</p>
<p>Dudley had me--Mother--he doesn't quite realize me yet, but he would.</p>
<p>He would. If Dudley had me--and leisure--if we could make him feel</p>
<p>that in permitting us to give, it is he, not us, who would be</p>
<p>conferring favor----"</p>
<p>"Oh I see," said Mrs. Oessetrich, her laughter like a burst string of</p>
<p>dropping beads, "my dear, clever second-born, the idea being to</p>
<p>prevail upon our whisk broom poet to overlook the crassness of the</p>
<p>offer and agree to live upon the bounty of a mother-in-law, whose</p>
<p>only excuse for being is that she apologetically may keep the poetic</p>
<p>hearth-fire burning."</p>
<p>"No--no----"</p>
<p>"Surely, my offspring, a plan to warm any parent's heart! Do</p>
<p>esoteric poets accept anything so crass in payment as coin of the</p>
<p>realm, or is there a more subtle way to cast gold-dust before the</p>
<p>whisk-broom suitor?"</p>
<p>Ermangarde let her head roll back as if she had been wounded.</p>
<p>"That's the trouble with mooning," said Mrs. Oessetrich. "It makes</p>
<p>fools of the best of us," and went out, sidestepping Bertha, who was</p>
<p>on her knees waxing the floor.</p>
<p>The woolen little polishing-pad made a soft, hurrying, whispering</p>
<p>noise and the floor began to gleam in pools and you walked on your</p>
<p>knees and squatted under the piano and stole in between the legs of</p>
<p>chairs.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ermangarde, left in a heap on the couch, thrust out her</p>
<p>hand, and Bertha, her own smelling of floor oil, took it and held it</p>
<p>there until the black wing of a December twilight came in through the</p>
<p>brocade window curtains and Ermangarde slept in such a tense little</p>
<p>ball, that in order to unhook her fingers, Bertha had finally to lift</p>
<p>them off one by one, like burrs.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the center of Bertha's brow the hair ran down in a peak. One</p>
<p>spring that peak began to whiten. Ashes of roses. It was curious</p>
<p>and a little bit sickening, seeing the white push its way through the</p>
<p>yellow. The dainty hoar of a first frost and yet, with the</p>
<p>immemorial gesture of women, Bertha sat before her bit of mirror</p>
<p>plucking the new white hairs and spreading them sadly along the back</p>
<p>of her hand. It was many a day before the new pale tinge came really</p>
<p>to be noticeable, but the lovely jonquil braids that she could wind</p>
<p>three times around her head were Bertha's vanity and she wept at</p>
<p>their passing.</p>
<p>Something new, too, and subtle, was letting down in Bertha. The</p>
<p>slowing of the engine. New tirednesses. Strange flushed lassitudes.</p>
<p>The plunge of her arm from the socket was no longer straight as the</p>
<p>drive of a piston. It broke at the elbow. It was still easy enough</p>
<p>to drag heavy objects with the hoist of a man, or tear at the</p>
<p>entrails of fowls with the old fiery clutch, but sometimes in the</p>
<p>eternal upstairs and downstairs the knees had a sense of giving way.</p>
<p>An absurd, empty, tickled feeling, as if they had each gone off into</p>
<p>little faints. There was nothing to do but wait then, holding on to</p>
<p>the balustrade until the strength flowed back into them.</p>
<p>The old lunge that could drive a keg halfway up a hillside; that</p>
<p>fling of the wrist that could squeeze a mop dry at one</p>
<p>turn--something had gone with the imperceptible, the pussy-foot</p>
<p>years. Jonquils. That plunging bison sense of excess strength.</p>
<p>And the din, the din of Mrs. Oessetrich. Sometimes the clatter of it</p>
<p>made Bertha want to cry. That was because she tired more easily.</p>
<p>The years were at her, but she called it neck-ache and bought a</p>
<p>bottle of liniment.</p>
<p>It was impossible to spend the every-other-Thursday-afternoon-off,</p>
<p>indoors. Mathilde Oessetrich was at you like a woodpecker.</p>
<p>"Bertha, since you are not going out this afternoon, I wish you would</p>
<p>help me take an invoice of the flat-silver for the insurance</p>
<p>company." Or: "Bertha, how can you sit there doing nothing even if</p>
<p>it is your day off? Boil up some suds and wash the crystal</p>
<p>chandelier in the drawing-room. And be careful, those pendants are</p>
<p>the finest cut-crystal."</p>
<p>There was no lock on her door and the imminence of these invasions</p>
<p>made her sit stiffly away from the back of her chair, fearing them.</p>
<p>So willy, nilly, on her every-other-Thursday afternoon, Bertha went</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>There was no place much to go except that Thurn's Department Store on</p>
<p>Fourteenth Street had a sheet music department, where they crashed</p>
<p>out the popular selections of the day on an upright piano. There was</p>
<p>always a little swirl of excitement around it and sometimes, if you</p>
<p>lingered on the edge, through the din and the clatter something sweet</p>
<p>came through.</p>
<p>And then one day, Mrs. Oessetrich sent her down to Arrow-maker's</p>
<p>department store to match some curtain net. That was a place to</p>
<p>know! You could walk all of every-other-Thursday afternoon in a</p>
<p>tropics of satin brocades and little wisps of fugitive perfume, and</p>
<p>at three o'clock an organ played out into the din and made it throb</p>
<p>like a heart. Then you could walk upstairs, the great stairs that</p>
<p>were as vain as the arch to the neck of a swan, and across an aerial</p>
<p>bridge that led from a Doge's palace into the dim Persia of the</p>
<p>Oriental room, where the rugs burned in strange, flameless fables</p>
<p>across the floor and squatting gods sat drowsy with centuries.</p>
<p>Sometimes the doors to the auditorium were open and no one cared if</p>
<p>you slipped in and sat down while the melody smoked out of the organ</p>
<p>pipes....</p>
<p>But then, gradually, Helga began to commandeer these afternoons. She</p>
<p>waited for Bertha in a drug store on Madison Avenue. Sometimes they</p>
<p>went to a motion picture theater or, if the weather was fine, walked</p>
<p>in Central Park. Strangely enough, for Helga, who was loquacious,</p>
<p>there was very little talk. So little that often they walked the</p>
<p>wind-swept rectangle of the reservoir in silence, their faces thrust</p>
<p>ahead for the slap of the gale and Helga's pretty fur scarf standing</p>
<p>out stiffly behind. Hand in hand. Helga liked to worm her palm up</p>
<p>into Bertha's as a child would, and then she had to take running</p>
<p>little steps to keep up. Bertha's strides were so long. Sometimes,</p>
<p>keeping up with her, Helga's breath began to come in gasps and tears</p>
<p>of effort popped out in her eyes. Tears that she seemed to like to</p>
<p>flagellate herself with, because she had to hurry with three steps to</p>
<p>Bertha's calm, unconscious one, until the blur before her eyes and</p>
<p>the pain in her side made the neat cinder path around the water a</p>
<p>morass, through which she began to stagger. Then they would sit,</p>
<p>still hand in hand, on a bench and watch the day wind down into dusk.</p>
<p>No talk, chiefly because when Helga began and her lips started to</p>
<p>shudder at what she had to say, she had not the strength, and had a</p>
<p>constant, a neurotic fear of fainting out in public places; and so</p>
<p>they sat silent or coaxed the squirrels or watched the children tear</p>
<p>past on roller skates and sometimes Bertha had little drony bits to</p>
<p>say of the Oessetrichs.</p>
<p>"Oessetrichs. Oessetrichs. I know why you are always rubbing it</p>
<p>into me that there's a good opening for a second girl, there. I</p>
<p>know!"</p>
<p>"I was yoost mentioning it, Helga."</p>
<p>"Ah no, you wasn't 'yoost mentioning it.' You're one of those</p>
<p>workers in the dark. It's not what you say. God knows where you got</p>
<p>the capacity for saying what you don't say. Well, lay off--don't you</p>
<p>worry about me."</p>
<p>"I--won't----"</p>
<p>"Well don't! Save it for the second girl at the Oessetrichs if they</p>
<p>are ever able to get one that's fool enough to stay."</p>
<p>But one Thursday evening long after, Helga sagged down so when they</p>
<p>came to their parting of the ways at the Madison Avenue drug store,</p>
<p>that Bertha had stiffly to hold her up by the arms for fear she was</p>
<p>going to fall.</p>
<p>"Helga?"</p>
<p>"You got me, Bertha. I--can't go--back--there. McMurtry--the</p>
<p>mouths--I can't go back. Take me, Bertha--do they still need</p>
<p>me--second girl----"</p>
<p>"I bane promising Mrs. Oessetrich I would get her a second girl.</p>
<p>You."</p>
<p>"I--I--never thought you would get me."</p>
<p>"Come, Helga."</p>
<p>And so the Oessetrichs acquired a second girl.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That was a winter to be remembered. Sometimes at night if Bertha so</p>
<p>much as threw herself across the bed for an instant before mustering</p>
<p>up the energy to undress, there she lay all night, prone, her heavy</p>
<p>shoes riveted to her feet and her clothing lumped clumsily between</p>
<p>her and complete rest.</p>
<p>To find the time and the strength somehow, so that it would seem as</p>
<p>if Helga herself had done it, to scour the pantry sinks. They were</p>
<p>of German silver and Mrs. Oessetrich was inordinately proud of them.</p>
<p>To beat the rugs for Helga's general cleaning day and keep for her</p>
<p>the enormous drawing-room pier glasses and the crystal chandeliers</p>
<p>and the bathroom fixtures glitteringly bright. To scurry upstairs</p>
<p>with the fire logs when Helga sank down crying with them on the</p>
<p>cellar stairs, and pile them outside the library door, so that all</p>
<p>there was left for Helga was to trip in and stack them in little</p>
<p>pyramids beside the copper scuttle.</p>
<p>It sapped you, not only the work of that, but the strain of that, and</p>
<p>then all the old querulousness was back in Helga. As the pretty</p>
<p>sheen to her hair dulled and the tips of her fingers began to spread</p>
<p>and the nails to break, her eyes sort of dimmed, as if two little</p>
<p>lamps had been hurried out of them and evenings up in the room she</p>
<p>shared with Bertha, the din of her talk beat down the sound of</p>
<p>Paula's playing and the wall was never a fan bowing, but of ochre and</p>
<p>green wallpaper, with one flap of it hanging down and showing the</p>
<p>naked plaster.</p>
<p>"Well, now you have me here, what are you going to do with me?"</p>
<p>"No, Helga, I--didn't----"</p>
<p>"Oh yes you did. You had your heart set on getting me here two years</p>
<p>before I give it a thought. Old Napoleon told me so herself. The</p>
<p>first night you was working here you promised to get her your friend</p>
<p>Helga for second girl. You got me here, you know you did!"</p>
<p>"Yes--Helga----"</p>
<p>"'Yes, Helga.' Well, I'm being a good girl. I'm back lugging the</p>
<p>wood to toast somebody else's toes and eating off the kitchen table</p>
<p>what's left off the dining room table. I'm back. I'm the servant</p>
<p>problem again. The problem without a chance. You have a thick hide,</p>
<p>you don't feel like I do."</p>
<p>"I feel----."</p>
<p>"Why, we ain't even got organization. The hodcarriers got that much.</p>
<p>We can't tell the truth about the kitchen side of the door, because</p>
<p>we ain't got the voice of organization. What's the answer? The</p>
<p>women who hire us call us an ungrateful lot and who is there to</p>
<p>answer back? Me? I got a fat chance getting listened to, ain't I?</p>
<p>Ungrateful! Ungrateful for what? That's what I want to know...."</p>
<p>"Helga, shh-h-h--Miss Paula----"</p>
<p>"There's nobody to get up and explain for us. The men don't know.</p>
<p>They get all their information from their women. That gives us a</p>
<p>helluva chance, don't it? And who is to dispute it all? We can't.</p>
<p>We ain't got the voice or the language. Nobody writes pieces or</p>
<p>prints articles about us from our side of the fence. We're not</p>
<p>interesting. Who wants to see a show about a servant? Who hears</p>
<p>anything about us except from what the women who hire us have to say</p>
<p>about us? God help a woman whose reputation depends entirely on what</p>
<p>another woman has to say about her. Well, it's that way with the</p>
<p>servant problem--every other kind of labor gets a hearing. We don't.</p>
<p>The public is satisfied to take the word of the women who hire us.</p>
<p>It's easier. Leave it to the public to take the easiest way!"</p>
<p>"Yah...."</p>
<p>"What kind of an angle on us do you think Mrs. Farley or Mrs.</p>
<p>Oessetrich give when they get up and spout about the servant problem</p>
<p>at one of their finger-roll-and-chicken-salad club meetings?"</p>
<p>"Helga, shh-h-h----"</p>
<p>"Yes, I said it. What do they know about us, except that we are</p>
<p>fourteen-hour-a-day machines that mustn't balk or break down, or we</p>
<p>get ungrateful? Ungrateful for what? Oh, God, tell me what?</p>
<p>Ungrateful because my life is chained to a sink. What's Ermangarde</p>
<p>Oessetrich done to make her so much better than I am that I got to</p>
<p>make her bed and pick up her silk nightgown after her? What's she</p>
<p>done that makes her the waited on and me the waiter on? Oh, you got</p>
<p>me back. But deep down in my heart I know it ain't worth being good</p>
<p>for. I'm like a kid sleeping on the floor. I can't fall outta bed</p>
<p>because there is no place to fall. See? That's me. I lose if I</p>
<p>win. There's a helluva lot of fun in a game like that. I lose if I</p>
<p>win."</p>
<p>Words. Words. Words. They beat about the little room in imprisoned</p>
<p>flutterings. Evenings of them. Weeks of them. Eternities of them.</p>
<p>Sometimes Helga fell asleep almost in the midst of what she was</p>
<p>saying, and had to be undressed and tucked in between the scrawny</p>
<p>covers.</p>
<p>She loved that moment of bed. The evening was like a nest to her,</p>
<p>into which she crawled drowsy with the sense of her safety.</p>
<p>Sometimes she sighed out and closed her eyes and snuggled her palm</p>
<p>very deeply up into Bertha's.</p>
<p>"I'm safe here with you, Bertha--never let anybody--get me. I'll</p>
<p>work. I'll pick up her nightgown and clean her shoes--my</p>
<p>side--that's what kills me--but keep me safe--Bertha--McMurtry--keep</p>
<p>me safe, Bertha----"</p>
<p>Then it was easiest to get her to sleep. She was like a child.</p>
<p>Relaxed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>About once a month the von Schlegels came to dine. He was president</p>
<p>of the Turnverein National Bank and also had enormous coffee</p>
<p>plantation holdings. She wore a diamond necklace entirely concealed</p>
<p>by the fold of fat at her neck. Hans von Schlegel was one day to die</p>
<p>at his desk of a stroke. He was already purpling.</p>
<p>One evening at a dinner to the von Schlegels, Ermangarde, who wore a</p>
<p>light blue taffeta dress sown in pearl passementerie and her hair in</p>
<p>two little round mats of braid over each ear, burst suddenly, and</p>
<p>apparently apropos of nothing, into such a fit of weeping that</p>
<p>between them, Paula and Bertha had literally to carry her upstairs.</p>
<p>The meal proceeded stiffly through, and Mrs. Oessetrich did not leave</p>
<p>the table. For an hour she and von Schlegel computed compound</p>
<p>interest, with Mrs. von Schlegel nodding and breathing down on her</p>
<p>bosom so loudly that the lace swayed. But after dessert she went</p>
<p>upstairs, holding her heavy green satin gown up about her as she bent</p>
<p>over Ermangarde, all her folderols of bead and bugle trimmings</p>
<p>dangling. The Oessetrichs dressed like that. Sharp hard colors.</p>
<p>Laid-on trimmings. Zouave jackets of spangled net. Appliqués. Not</p>
<p>even the girls dressed wisely. Olga, to be sure, had her somewhat</p>
<p>mannish, modish manner, but her tweeds were thick and her expensive</p>
<p>felt hats had a dowdy droop. Mrs. Oessetrich loved parrot green. It</p>
<p>covered her like a shellac, and her chapped-looking arms and bosom</p>
<p>rose out of it and made her as brilliant-looking as a cockatoo.</p>
<p>"What is this? Don't you feel well, Ermangarde? Bertha, go</p>
<p>downstairs and send Helga into the drawing-room with the coffee and</p>
<p>liqueurs."</p>
<p>By this time, Ermangarde, her storm of crying over, and lying wanly</p>
<p>in the crumple of blue taffeta dress, opened her salt-bitten eyes.</p>
<p>"No, Bertha, don't you go. Stay here. I'm sorry, Mother, I must</p>
<p>have been a little hysterical. I didn't mean to...."</p>
<p>"Does anything hurt you? Are you ill? No? Well then, bathe your</p>
<p>eyes and come downstairs. The von Schlegels want a little bridge."</p>
<p>Paula, who had been sitting at her sister's head, looked up at this,</p>
<p>her eyes the curious blue of flame burning along the top of cognac.</p>
<p>Thin flame through which you could see the clear empty bottoms.</p>
<p>"Why, Mother! Ermangarde can't go downstairs any more this evening.</p>
<p>She's had another nervous chill."</p>
<p>"Nonsense. A lovesick chill. A little self-control is the best kind</p>
<p>of treatment. It makes it extremely awkward----"</p>
<p>"I'll go down, Mother, in Ermie's place."</p>
<p>"Very well. I suppose it will appear no more peculiar to have</p>
<p>Ermangarde up here in a love trance, than it would be if you were to</p>
<p>remain upstairs mooning with your music."</p>
<p>"Mother, I----"</p>
<p>"I suppose I may as well reconcile myself to a neurotic family of</p>
<p>girls. Bertha, when Miss Ermangarde is finished having you hold her</p>
<p>hand, I wish you would hasten downstairs. That girl Helga, for some</p>
<p>reason, becomes a perfect moron when you are not about. If you need</p>
<p>anything, Ermangarde, you can ring," said Mrs. Oessetrich, and</p>
<p>bounced out, slamming the door.</p>
<p>But at two o'clock that morning, with Bertha still holding her hand,</p>
<p>Ermangarde drifted off into such a gale of sobbing that Doctor</p>
<p>Ehrenfest, the family physician, was finally called and the aroused</p>
<p>household scurried through hallways in kimonos and soft slippers.</p>
<p>Lights were blazing on all floors and Mrs. Oessetrich in a padded</p>
<p>house gown, and her head in a fury of crimpers, was pale as china.</p>
<p>"Come now." said Dr. Ehrenfest, who had assisted the three Misses</p>
<p>Oessetrich into the world, "we must get to the bottom of what is</p>
<p>troubling this child. Love affair? Out with it, Ermie, you can't</p>
<p>fool your Uncle Ehrenfest."</p>
<p>But the squirt of morphia into Ermangarde's left arm was already</p>
<p>carrying her off down strange rivers, her closed lids quivering and</p>
<p>her cheeks, down which the tears had stormed, lashed and</p>
<p>blanched-looking. Paula, at the head of Ermangarde's bed, kept her</p>
<p>head averted because she was crying.</p>
<p>A silent, eerie little group. Bertha, crouched there beside the bed,</p>
<p>because Ermangarde's fingers were tight as wire around her wrist and</p>
<p>would not let go. Paula with her queer-looking, blue-flame eyes.</p>
<p>Mathilde Oessetrich, china-white and a little frightened, standing</p>
<p>there at the footboard and gazing down on to the bed. The</p>
<p>professional-looking face of the doctor beginning to pucker wisely.</p>
<p>"Mathilde, have you been up to your old tricks of taking captaincy of</p>
<p>another daughter's soul?"</p>
<p>A long sob forced itself through Paula's clenched lips.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, I suppose it's her appendicitis pain again."</p>
<p>"No, the child's case doesn't diagnose that readily. This appendix</p>
<p>seems to be up under her heart or in her brain. We can't cut to find</p>
<p>this pain. We have to probe."</p>
<p>"That is mid-victorian. Girls don't do it any more. Swooning off at</p>
<p>love affairs. Pish."</p>
<p>"Ah, now we are getting at it. Then there _is_----"</p>
<p>"Oh, Ehrenfest, you're an old granny. Always have been. Suppose</p>
<p>there is. It just isn't done--it isn't nice--prostrating herself in</p>
<p>this fashion. Dramatics, I call it."</p>
<p>"The child hasn't prostrated herself, Mathilde. She is in a state of</p>
<p>nervous collapse. We must get at the source of this thing, and see</p>
<p>what's to be done before she comes out from under the influence."</p>
<p>Paula turned her eyes upon her parent.</p>
<p>"Tell him, Mother."</p>
<p>"Tell him? Tell him what? This is abominable. Having my children</p>
<p>talk to me and of me as if I were a criminal."</p>
<p>"Tell him, Mother."</p>
<p>"Tell him that the only normal strong and capable member of this</p>
<p>family is myself?"</p>
<p>"Tell him about Dudley."</p>
<p>"Well, then, Ehrey, I suppose I am to confess to you, like a culprit</p>
<p>parent, that Dudley Wells is the occasion of Ermangarde's brain</p>
<p>storm."</p>
<p>"The author?"</p>
<p>"I thought the incident was closed and forgotten when he suddenly</p>
<p>ceased coming here about a month ago. That is the sum total of it,</p>
<p>so far as I know. But if that is the cause of Ermangarde's brain</p>
<p>storm, I beg to be excused. I am going back to bed."</p>
<p>"Mother--that isn't the sum total----"</p>
<p>"It is a blessing I have a sense of humor to fall back upon. If ever</p>
<p>a woman has tried to rear her daughters into self-sufficient,</p>
<p>independent women, capable of swinging the great fortunes which will</p>
<p>ultimately come into their hands, I have. I brought a great fortune</p>
<p>into my marriage and, if I do say it I have managed and enlarged it</p>
<p>with the clearsightedness of an entire corporation. I have tried to</p>
<p>rear my girls toward that ideal of self-sufficiency. I have tried to</p>
<p>inoculate them with a realization of their own social and economic</p>
<p>integrity. I have----"</p>
<p>"But, my dear Mathilde, nature is----"</p>
<p>"Bah! Nature is a trickster. Let the weak succumb. If my girls</p>
<p>must marry, let them use the same judgment and discrimination about</p>
<p>it that I expect them to use in the management of affairs not so</p>
<p>vital to their well-being. Nature tricks the weak. Gray matter, not</p>
<p>passion, rules the strong. You've something of a sense of humor</p>
<p>yourself, Ehrenfest. It should afford you a real laugh. Me of all</p>
<p>women! Even Olga, I hear, is having herself psychoanalyzed in quest</p>
<p>of her particular sex complex. Ermangarde here in hysterics because</p>
<p>of a poet who wears a size fifteen collar, and Paula bemoaning her</p>
<p>girlhood away because the man she fancied herself in love with had</p>
<p>the good judgment to take himself down to Porto Rico and----"</p>
<p>"You drove him!"</p>
<p>"Ermangarde! 'Tilda! Not that old argument now, please!"</p>
<p>"But she did, Ehrey! She did! She drove him down there just as</p>
<p>surely as if she had pursued him every inch of the way. Ridiculed</p>
<p>him down there. Harrison wasn't made for that swampy coffee</p>
<p>country.... It was like sending him to his death ... a subtle,</p>
<p>terrible way of doing it."</p>
<p>"Paula, you don't know what you are saying----"</p>
<p>"I know I don't, Ehrey. I'm sorry, Mother. I guess I--I am queer,</p>
<p>Mother, just as you say I am. So queer that--that sometimes it</p>
<p>frightens me--frightens me so that I cannot stand by now and see my</p>
<p>little sister--Ermangarde--clutching on so to those illusions you are</p>
<p>snatching from her. Olga is trying to fight her way clear. I don't</p>
<p>matter any more. But Ermie! Mother, don't try to standardize us all</p>
<p>according to your ideas of strength and efficiency. We are more like</p>
<p>my father must have been."</p>
<p>"That's what I'm struggling to save you from, if you only had the</p>
<p>good sense to know it."</p>
<p>"We are not the strong, fearless captains of women that you want us</p>
<p>to be. Not even Olga! Let us be what we are, Mother. Don't break</p>
<p>us all with your will."</p>
<p>"'Tilda, these are stern words for your daughter to have to use."</p>
<p>"It's Ermie, Ehrey, that gives me the courage to use them. She won't</p>
<p>talk about it, not even to me, but Mother has driven Dudley away,</p>
<p>too. He hasn't been here for weeks. Mother, hasn't it meant</p>
<p>anything to you, Ermie's face, those weeks while Dudley was coming?</p>
<p>Her new prettiness, Mother?--you--why--why that girl</p>
<p>there--Bertha--that servant sitting there holding Ermie's hand has</p>
<p>been more to her these weeks--kinder--more understanding. Mother,</p>
<p>Ermie's stubborn. She's been going about with Ewald ever since</p>
<p>Dudley left. Don't drive her to things like that--or worse. Ewald</p>
<p>isn't the man for her to be spending her time with. Mother, change</p>
<p>your attitude to Dudley. Bring him back. You be the one to take the</p>
<p>initiative. Oh Mother, give her what she wants. What is the result</p>
<p>of what's happened? Our Ermie, sneaking around with Spencer Ewald, a</p>
<p>married man twice her age. Mother--make things right."</p>
<p>"Mathilde, Paula is right. There is a time for everything. The time</p>
<p>has come for you to give in to Ermangarde."</p>
<p>"Sentimental nonsense!"</p>
<p>"You've a sick child there, Mathilde."</p>
<p>"Well, where is he? What has become of him? Who frightened him off?</p>
<p>In my day it took more than a foolish old irate parent to----"</p>
<p>Ermangarde stirred there on the bed then, and began to cry through</p>
<p>her tightly closed lids.</p>
<p>"Ermangarde, look up, child, it is your old hobgoblin, Ehrey."</p>
<p>"Ermie, see, dear. It's Paula. Open your eyes. See, dear, we're</p>
<p>all here. Everything is all right. Mother is as anxious as any of</p>
<p>us for Dudley to come back--aren't you, Mother? Aren't you, Mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"See, and everything is going to be happy and lovely, dear. Ermie,</p>
<p>you don't have to talk, dear. Just whisper to us where to reach</p>
<p>Dudley. Mother and all of us want it that way. Let go of Bertha's</p>
<p>hand, dear. See, here is Mother's instead. Tell us, dear, where we</p>
<p>can reach Dudley...."</p>
<p>For answer, with two great blisters of tears forcing their way out of</p>
<p>her closed eyes, Ermangarde reached under her pillow for a little wad</p>
<p>of envelope concealed there and, burying her head under the bolster</p>
<p>so that her sobs were muffled, handed the bit of paper up to Paula:</p>
<p>"_Ermangarde_," it read, "_your little notes make it so hard. I have</p>
<p>not seen you in all these weeks, well because, and I should, I must</p>
<p>tell you, one night something inside of me just curled up and died._</p>
<p>"_It seems too dreadful, for me, who dwells down where the hem of</p>
<p>your skirt touches, to have to be the one to write these words. But</p>
<p>somehow I must find the strength to be brutal with the truth.</p>
<p>Something, little Ermangarde, killed the perfect thing that was</p>
<p>forming between us. Something too subtle and too cruel for me to</p>
<p>analyse, but toward the end, dear girl, I never put my foot into your</p>
<p>home without a dreadful crushing sense of the imminence of the death</p>
<p>that was taking place in my heart._</p>
<p>"_Forces too enormous and too infinitesimal for us to cope with were</p>
<p>at work. The shortcomings were all mine, but alas! there they were.</p>
<p>It makes this letter a bitterer task for me to be obliged to close it</p>
<p>on a note of my own happiness. I was married yesterday to Rosemary.</p>
<p>You remember the night we met her at the play. And that is just what</p>
<p>she is. Rosemary. A lovely sprig of it, and she has turned life</p>
<p>into a garden. We are sailing to-morrow for the Madeiras.</p>
<p>Ermangarde, try to remember me kindly, as I shall always remember</p>
<p>you, beautifully._</p>
<p>"_Dudley Wells._"</p>
<p>After the three of them had read this, standing there shoulder to</p>
<p>shoulder and their breathing beating down on to the page, Paula</p>
<p>turned suddenly upon her mother, the blue flames, thin as breath,</p>
<p>leaping along her eyes.</p>
<p>"I hate you, Mathilde Oessetrich. I hate you. I hate you." And</p>
<p>cramming her handkerchief up against the terrifying words, ran</p>
<p>choking from the room.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And yet the very next morning Ermangarde was up and about as usual.</p>
<p>There was something diamond-like in her brightness. Hard. Showy.</p>
<p>She was even rude to Paula.</p>
<p>"Don't try to baby me, Paula. I'm all right, I won't stay in bed!</p>
<p>Do keep out of my affairs, dear. I know what I'm about. I'm quite</p>
<p>well. Don't interfere."</p>
<p>So Paula went back to weaving her hours of music along the keys and</p>
<p>Ermangarde to the routine of her French and her drawing and her</p>
<p>fencing and her singing lessons. And if once in a while she skipped</p>
<p>a luncheon or a dinner for which there was no particular accounting,</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich held thin-lipped peace. There was that dry, diamond</p>
<p>hardness to Ermangarde.</p>
<p>Every Saturday, Madam Lina Gerbhardt, Mrs. Oessetrich's lifelong</p>
<p>friend, an enormous contralto who wore stencilled scarves and had</p>
<p>taught Calvé, came to the house to give Ermangarde her singing</p>
<p>lesson, and then remained for lunch. Ermangarde had a clear little</p>
<p>mountain stream of a voice. Lovely in its middle register and with a</p>
<p>thin fluty upper range to which she had climbed on years of Madam</p>
<p>Gerbhardt's careful _arpeggios_. It was pleasant, during these</p>
<p>lessons, to dust softly about the hall that led to the music room.</p>
<p>"Do--me--fah--doh--fah--sol--me--doh--ahh-h-hhhhh--"</p>
<p>Madam Gerbhardt's voice ran underneath Ermangarde's, booming it.</p>
<p>"Doh--me--fah--doh----"</p>
<p>Light-colored Tosti bubbles. Flying banners of Bizet. Richard</p>
<p>Strauss.</p>
<p>Bertha liked these lessons. Once Madam Gerbhardt thrust two tickets</p>
<p>into Bertha's hands. "Here, girl, there is a Ukrainian chorus</p>
<p>singing at Carnegie Hall to-night. You should enjoy that. Go, if</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich can spare you."</p>
<p>Bertha went and took Helga. The seats were very far back and the</p>
<p>faces of the chorus dim as dreams. The drony silence while you</p>
<p>waited. The yellow slits of light. The Slav songs that were full of</p>
<p>heart beat and the Slav songs that were full of despair. The love of</p>
<p>a harlot. The death of a Moujik. Cossacks who chant at dusk. It</p>
<p>was as if the heart were embers and the chorus were sitting in its</p>
<p>glow. Love and life and the taste of the red lips of harlots and the</p>
<p>running of rivers that are made of tears. There was one. It sang of</p>
<p>the Volga. The Volga! Boatmen whose thighs were sweating and whose</p>
<p>eyes were bulging from the drag. The pulling boatmen along the</p>
<p>shore....</p>
<p>"Come," said Helga when the intermission came. "Let's run along.</p>
<p>These Polish wops give me the blues."</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but go. Helga could be so querulous. But up</p>
<p>under the roof, all of the night rocked softly, like a river. The</p>
<p>Volga. The Volga. Rushing of tears along with the tide and where</p>
<p>men sang of joy in a key that was minor....</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One lovely spring Saturday when the breakfast room, where the family</p>
<p>lunched, was wide open to the languid drift of spring, Madam</p>
<p>Gerbhardt, who had been popping salted almonds into her mouth,</p>
<p>chopping them sharply and then popping more, spoke out suddenly, just</p>
<p>as Bertha was passing her the fillet of sole:</p>
<p>"Well, I see where Rollo Farley died."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Yes, didn't you read it in the _Times_ this morning? It seems he</p>
<p>spoke at the Poetry Society night before last, complained of feeling</p>
<p>ill when he arrived home, took a sleeping powder before he went to</p>
<p>bed, and never woke up. Oh!"</p>
<p>"Bertha, you clumsy!"</p>
<p>"It's all right, no harm done."</p>
<p>"Bertha, do be careful. She didn't ruin your sleeve with the fish</p>
<p>sauce, did she? Bertha, Helga should be serving anyhow. I cannot</p>
<p>understand why you insist upon carrying half of that careless girl's</p>
<p>work for her--so Rollo Farley is dead."</p>
<p>"Rollo--Farley----"</p>
<p>"A greatly overestimated man. A one-book author."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mother, but what a book! I think that _The Cathedral Under the</p>
<p>Sea_ belongs to the esoteric group of really great poems."</p>
<p>"Pish. Free verse. Free-and-easy-verse. I hate faddism. The forms</p>
<p>that were good enough for Goethe and Wordsworth and----"</p>
<p>"Have you read _The Cathedral Under the Sea_, Mother?"</p>
<p>"No, but I know what the entire movement stands for. You belong to</p>
<p>the violent reactionaries if you permit two lines to rhyme. A</p>
<p>couplet is about as out of date as an antimacassar."</p>
<p>"You speak precisely with the authority of one who knows nothing</p>
<p>about the subject."</p>
<p>"At least, Ermangarde, I am not a reactionary in the way I permit my</p>
<p>daughters to address me."</p>
<p>"But, Mother, you must admit that at least I speak with the authority</p>
<p>of having read the book. _The Cathedral Under the Sea_ is a great</p>
<p>impressionistic poem, not the mere dithyrambic prose that the free</p>
<p>verse writers are dabbling in. Its metrical devices are as cunning</p>
<p>as Masefield's effects of the rolling of the sea."</p>
<p>"Now, when you speak of Masefield----"</p>
<p>"Exactly, Mother, it is because you can appreciate Masefield, that I</p>
<p>won't have you condemning Rollo Farley before you have read _The</p>
<p>Cathedral Under the Sea_."</p>
<p>"Ermangarde is right, 'Tilda. Farley accepts technique without being</p>
<p>tied to it."</p>
<p>"Of course he does. He does precisely what your Masefield does. He</p>
<p>does what he pleases with his rhyme scheme between his first and his</p>
<p>sixth or seventh lines but those lines hold the internal ones firmly</p>
<p>together. Farley is not an anarchist. He's merely a Progressive.</p>
<p>He dares to liberate form and language."</p>
<p>"Pish, you've read that somewhere."</p>
<p>"I've felt it, you mean. Besides I'm not bothered about form. Much</p>
<p>of the beauty of _The Cathedral Under the Sea_ lies in its</p>
<p>formlessness--the formlessness of life. You understand, don't you,</p>
<p>Madam?"</p>
<p>Madam, who had a pudgy, a square, an emotional hand, placed it to the</p>
<p>left of her stencilled scarf and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>"Indeed I do. Any work of art, regardless of its form or</p>
<p>formlessness, is great when it makes you feel that its creator has</p>
<p>dipped into your very heart for his sensation."</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"That turbulent, inarticulate creature in _The Cathedral Under the</p>
<p>Sea_! I can see her sitting there, beautiful-eyed and barefoot, in</p>
<p>the forest part of the poem. You remember? Listening. I suppose to</p>
<p>the music of the spheres. Hearing it, full of it, and yet silent</p>
<p>with it. That is how I feel about so much that is beautiful and</p>
<p>fragile in life. Full of it, bursting with it, and yet with no power</p>
<p>to express it."</p>
<p>"Oh Madam, you _do_ understand!"</p>
<p>"That is what I meant, Ermangarde, in our lesson this very morning.</p>
<p>Lift the tones, or they will sink back into the pools of silence and</p>
<p>remain unsung. Can't you understand, Mathilde, why we--why that one</p>
<p>beautiful thing, even though he never wrote a line that amounted to a</p>
<p>hill of beans afterward, can perpetuate the name of Rollo Farley?"</p>
<p>"I must read it for myself," said Mrs. Oessetrich. "I am always</p>
<p>prejudiced in advance by a book which has created the furor that this</p>
<p>one did. I've never been able to abide his wife. She was a</p>
<p>Neidringhaus. Ethan's daughter. One of those Botticelli creatures</p>
<p>who is all effect and little else. And how she has capitalized the</p>
<p>success of _The Cathedral Under the Sea_! I actually think she</p>
<p>sometimes believes that she wrote it herself. Her proprietary air.</p>
<p>They were wretchedly unhappy together, you know. Services from the</p>
<p>old house in Gramercy Park, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Thursday afternoon."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not going. I might have put myself out while his mother</p>
<p>lived. Lucretia Farley was at least harmless and not an</p>
<p>attitudinizing Mona Lisa. Bertha, get Circle 345 for me on the</p>
<p>telephone. I'll be half an hour late for my bridge lesson at this</p>
<p>rate. Paula, for heaven's sake, stop staring. You are getting the</p>
<p>habit. If it is one thing I can't abide, it is light blue eyes that</p>
<p>stare ..."</p>
<p>"_The Cathedral Under the Sea_," said Paula. "I was just trying to</p>
<p>think: Where--The Cathedral Under the</p>
<p>Sea--I--know--her--from--somewhere----"</p>
<p>How curious, turning the corner, just as the bier, slanting, was</p>
<p>being carried down the steps. The violet blanket, starlit with</p>
<p>anemones, slid a little. Its fragrance stole out softly over the</p>
<p>fringe of onlookers. They formed the aisle, these onlookers. The</p>
<p>bier passed between them, across the sidewalk and into the hearse.</p>
<p>The blanket kept breathing out fragrance. You wanted to faint into</p>
<p>it. Sweet. Wistful. Tired. It rode on shoulders and rolled a</p>
<p>little, that hoisted caravan of Rollo, and the sidewalk was a desert</p>
<p>and the blanket a purple sky with stars and the end of the desert was</p>
<p>Rollo's eternity.</p>
<p>Something rather sickening happened then and brought you back into</p>
<p>the fringe of the onlookers. The bier was tilted into the hearse.</p>
<p>It ran forward a little as if on casters, and two doors with silver</p>
<p>handles closed and pinched your heart. The doors closing that way.</p>
<p>Like shutting a dear book that had a filigree lock on it and turning</p>
<p>the tiny key. The doors closing. The last line of a sonnet.</p>
<p>You stood in the fringe that made the aisle through which the bier</p>
<p>passed across the sidewalk, with a place nicked out of your heart.</p>
<p>And then the hearse moved up and a carriage slid into its place, and</p>
<p>down the steps, through the sweet breath the violets had left, came</p>
<p>the mourners. Mr. Farley. It hurt somehow to look. The years had</p>
<p>shrunk him up. He seemed shorter, and all the bombastic pink flesh</p>
<p>hung now in pale little oysters of empty skin, and his legs, that had</p>
<p>used to be fat and strutty, wavered now, and kept wanting to knock at</p>
<p>the knees. It was horrible to see him feel three times with the toe</p>
<p>of his shoe before he ventured the step.</p>
<p>With Veronica it was different. Her foot came down coolly and slimly</p>
<p>just where she pointed it, and through the mesh of her veil you could</p>
<p>see the pale ellipse of her face. Dim. But the features in order.</p>
<p>The neatly closed lips. Careful curtains of hair. A griefless face.</p>
<p>Dry and oval. Ascetic even of tears.</p>
<p>It made one proud. So burstingly proud to stand there on the fringe</p>
<p>of the onlookers, rich with the grief that the face of Veronica was</p>
<p>as barren of as a crag. To stand there rich and brimming with the</p>
<p>precious sorrow of a love! Poor Veronica, who had no grief.</p>
<p>Gradually the carriages were filled. There were the explorer and the</p>
<p>broker and the ex-ambassador and Beebe, only without his portfolio,</p>
<p>who had interrupted the family at luncheon that day and caused the</p>
<p>nesselrode pudding to go out untasted.</p>
<p>The women whispered and made little sounds like the glass icicles of</p>
<p>a chandelier. The ushers brushed their white gloved hands together.</p>
<p>It was all very cool and very tearless, and the carriages began to</p>
<p>move off without more ado.</p>
<p>It was easy in the city to keep pace with them. There were long</p>
<p>halts for traffic and the horses, never out of walk, lifted their</p>
<p>hoofs with almost a rhythmic leisure. Clip. Clop. The wheels, slow</p>
<p>hoops. Unflecked drivers' whips. Wide sun-washed streets, drowsy</p>
<p>with spring afternoon, and the narrow black procession winding out</p>
<p>along them. Bertha followed from the sidewalk. It was easy, block</p>
<p>after block, but then up over the shoulder of an asphalt hill, the</p>
<p>green flush of the country set in and the sidewalks left off and now</p>
<p>you had to follow more quickly along the stiff frozen dirt road, but</p>
<p>just the same you wound along behind, sweetly and deeply into the</p>
<p>quiet. Clip. Clop.</p>
<p>The caravan of Rollo rolling rapidly now, out toward the sun's edge,</p>
<p>and Bertha with her gift of grief hurrying after it. She could feel</p>
<p>her shoulders spangled with perspiration. They had been so deeply</p>
<p>white to him, like the flesh of the magnolia. He had trolled four of</p>
<p>his fingers along her whiteness. They had melted against her throat</p>
<p>and down into her heart. White tapering roads, in the dark forest</p>
<p>along which she ran calling.</p>
<p>The first minarets of the cemetery came up over the next hill. Pale</p>
<p>moonrises against afternoon sky. A white battalion of a city, there</p>
<p>at attention in the spring afternoon. The winding grind of the</p>
<p>gravel roads, and the creeping sweetness of the earth. You could</p>
<p>almost taste it. How they ground and squeaked, those wheels, and the</p>
<p>horses made great splashes of gravel, and the sentinel city stood</p>
<p>unbowing as Rollo rode in.</p>
<p>The little pop-ups of anemones. There was a turned-over clump of</p>
<p>them beside the grave, standing there on their heads waiting to be</p>
<p>patted down into turf again.</p>
<p>There was a yew tree grew beside an urn. Quiet of that! It made the</p>
<p>day seem to pause.</p>
<p>The group tightened up around the grave. Closed solidarity of those</p>
<p>backs again. But down on the lovely slant of hill the yew grew</p>
<p>beside the urn and it was pleasant to wait there in the freckled</p>
<p>shade. It ran along Bertha and mottled her into the background. It</p>
<p>made her the color of a sparrow in a tree.</p>
<p>The white and listening marbles. The hill might have been a tripod</p>
<p>and the faint throbbing of the burial service a slow rhythmic incense</p>
<p>stealing down among the headstones.</p>
<p>A poet was dead.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Long after the carriages had crunched down along the drive again, and</p>
<p>the hearse, lighter now, and looking silly with haste had turned</p>
<p>cityward, Bertha stole up to the hill. The sun was gone, and in</p>
<p>between the serried ranks of the white battalions the light was the</p>
<p>color of sabre steel. The stars, too, had that steely aloofness of a</p>
<p>spring day turned suddenly dead cold. They were the very early</p>
<p>stars, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, who love in their seasons, to edge</p>
<p>the day.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The anemones were back in place. They had been patted there with the</p>
<p>broad side of a spade. They looked broken-necked and dying. But the</p>
<p>mound itself was raw and brown and its breath came up at you like a</p>
<p>sigh. There was a pillow of roses at the head. An empty bed. Rollo</p>
<p>was gone. You could sit and weep now, unashamedly.</p>
<p>Rollo must know by now. Everything.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Strange Paula. Sometimes now, she did not leave her room for a week.</p>
<p>She played a great deal, for hours, in the whispering fashion up</p>
<p>alone in her room. Beethoven. Brahms. More Beethoven. And sewed</p>
<p>too. Pink wispy things that grew into a pile and then were folded</p>
<p>away in trunks between tissue paper.</p>
<p>"Nutty" was Helga's frequent and succinct comment. Her eyes could</p>
<p>seem to water at the evidences of pale finery strewn about Paula's</p>
<p>fourth floor room. She fingered the stuffs as if they were flesh,</p>
<p>and once Bertha walked in on her posing before Paula's dressing</p>
<p>mirror, a web of a nightgown, with two lace butterflies poised on the</p>
<p>shoulder straps, held up before her.</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't I? She's just my age. The Lord gave me the same kind</p>
<p>of flesh. I love it, too. Anyway, she's nutty."</p>
<p>"You mustn't touch anything of hers!"</p>
<p>"Why not? She's no better than me. She thinks what I out and did.</p>
<p>What do you think is in the mind of a girl who sits here day after</p>
<p>day making flimsies like these, when she isn't even going to be</p>
<p>married? She is no better with her mind than I am with my body.</p>
<p>Only she is protected from doing what nobody gave a tinker's dam</p>
<p>whether I done or not. This poor little nut thinks she's making a</p>
<p>trousseau."</p>
<p>"Why not? Maybe she is."</p>
<p>"Why not? Eddie the chauffeur told me why not. There's no man. He</p>
<p>passed out. He wasn't much of a go-getter and old Napoleon sent him</p>
<p>down to the coffee plantations and he ate a few fever germs. It's a</p>
<p>phony trousseau for a spooky groom. Old Napoleon knows. She comes</p>
<p>up when the stuff gets too cluttery and packs it away herself in the</p>
<p>trunks. Haven't you ever seen Miss Paula stare when she does it?</p>
<p>That kid's queer. She sits up here staring at what she's missed.</p>
<p>Sewing for what she's missed and trying to play on the piano what</p>
<p>she's missed. Only she's protected from going out after what she's</p>
<p>missed. That's the only difference between her being good and me</p>
<p>bad."</p>
<p>"Helga, put it down. Someone is coming. Mrs. Oessetrich."</p>
<p>"Bertha, Miss Olga has just telephoned from her Settlement House. It</p>
<p>is Commencement day for the girls in her Vocational Guidance Classes.</p>
<p>Those nice girls are being graduated into full-fledged milliners.</p>
<p>She wants the two silver punch bowls. The big car is up for repairs</p>
<p>and Eddie has Miss Ermangarde out in the sedan. I'll have to send</p>
<p>you down with them in a taxi."</p>
<p>"Yah----."</p>
<p>"I do believe you are up here doing Helga's sweeping for her! What</p>
<p>are you made of? Cast iron? Helga, you shameless girl, you, letting</p>
<p>Bertha carry your share of the work in this fashion month after</p>
<p>month. Get down the two silver punch bowls, Bertha. Never mind,</p>
<p>Helga, I'll put away those pink things of Miss Paula's. The idea,</p>
<p>Bertha up here doing your sweeping for you. Doing the work for two.</p>
<p>What is that girl made of? Sometimes, I wonder...."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Vocational Guidance House on Christie Street had no trade</p>
<p>entrance. Only a neat front door, painted red. It stood open, and</p>
<p>it was all that Bertha could do to wedge in sidewise with the</p>
<p>outlandish bulge of her punch bowls.</p>
<p>The door to the left of the bare hallway was also open. What had</p>
<p>once been two parlors of a private residence were thrown into one.</p>
<p>It made a sort of small lecture hall, with a platform at one end and</p>
<p>rows of camp chairs facing it. An American flag covered one wall and</p>
<p>there were white Swiss window curtains and geraniums in bright blue</p>
<p>pots and over the platform the usual engraved, "Opening of the First</p>
<p>Continental Congress" and "Franklin before the House of Lords."</p>
<p>Odor of embalmed philanthropy.</p>
<p>There were three rows of girls seated on the platform. Latin-looking</p>
<p>faces beneath smooth, tamed hair and their young bodies seeming to</p>
<p>flicker under the prisons of the neat blue skirts and white</p>
<p>shirtwaists.</p>
<p>Blazing absence of blazing neckerchiefs and of blazing skirts.</p>
<p>Doused Carmens.</p>
<p>An audience with firm, dry, Anglo-Saxon lips sat along the camp</p>
<p>chairs and stared up at them. The safe, trained little Carmens who</p>
<p>used toothbrushes and knew now, with an Anglo-Saxon finality, that a</p>
<p>rose between the lips was not a rose at all, but lechery. Olga</p>
<p>Oessetrich was speaking from the platform.</p>
<p>It was easy to hear through the open doorway. Olga's voice was so</p>
<p>clear. As clear as her face with the hair worn smoothly away from</p>
<p>it. As clear as her hands, white square hands that came out boldly</p>
<p>from the mannish cuffs.</p>
<p>It was pleasant just to stand there and peer over the great</p>
<p>protruding armful of bowls. Olga, who when she came to the house,</p>
<p>only sat about with her long indolent legs crossed and watched the</p>
<p>smoke of her cigarette with her eyes like slits, here now, eager, and</p>
<p>talking down into those careful-lipped faces with a fine young fervor.</p>
<p>Every so often a little patter of hand-clapping broke through and</p>
<p>then she stood and waited, her arms folded across her flat boyish</p>
<p>bosom and her glance sure as a shot down into her audience.</p>
<p>And then the girls with the Latin faces and the bodies like the</p>
<p>quiver of flame began to pass one by one for the tubes of white paper</p>
<p>that were bound with red ribbon. Olga handing them, one to each,</p>
<p>from the pyramid of them upon the table. Each girl as she passed</p>
<p>stood for a moment in the little area of Olga's words, flushed, and</p>
<p>then sat down to applause. Slim sapling girls with smooth hair and</p>
<p>stiff cuffs like Olga's. Oh, how you wanted to think it was fine ...</p>
<p>all the doused Carmens....</p>
<p>Suddenly Bertha moved forward, so that her head protruded in. Olga's</p>
<p>voice and the face of one of the thin sapling girls were so clear....</p>
<p>"... this young woman need feel no embarrassment as I dwell upon</p>
<p>these facts of her early childhood. She is a glory to our</p>
<p>institution, and those of you who have endowed us so generously in</p>
<p>the past may well look upon this girl with a kind of pride that will</p>
<p>inspire you to endow us still more generously in the future.</p>
<p>"Some gracious maternal scheme of things threw her into our midst at</p>
<p>the age of fourteen. She has developed from the pinched little</p>
<p>undersized waif she then was into a young woman who is prepared to</p>
<p>take up her place in the world with dignity and self-respect.</p>
<p>"Chita Migulchi, I have the honor to award you the first honorable</p>
<p>mention in your class and a diploma which registers you at our</p>
<p>industrial bureau as a graduate milliner of the Christie Street</p>
<p>Vocational Guidance School for Girls."</p>
<p>Chita! Chita! You wanted to cry, your throat was so warm and full.</p>
<p>Little Chita with the Jocko eyes, but her face smooth now and the</p>
<p>lovely pallor of nun's veiling. The well-brushed sheen of her hair.</p>
<p>It was hard not to cry with the warmness and fullness. It pressed up</p>
<p>against the eyeballs and made them dim. You kept pushing open the</p>
<p>door ... Chita....</p>
<p>That made a draught and someone wanted the door closed. It swung to</p>
<p>with a little nick. It left you standing in the hall, which had</p>
<p>grown very dark, hugging those preposterous punch-bowls and groping</p>
<p>your way toward the basement kitchen.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was something about Ermangarde's smile that glinted. She did</p>
<p>it with her lips closed and with the merest lifting of their corners.</p>
<p>It was a cold ray of a smile, that made you think of pale-flanked</p>
<p>little fish swimming snugly under ice. Her open laugh never came</p>
<p>through any more. She smiled constantly, but with her lips in their</p>
<p>rigid icicle. You were conscious of the warm white young teeth</p>
<p>behind them, but they never lit up her inscrutability. Sometimes her</p>
<p>mother regarded her with small, bright, cockatoo eyes.</p>
<p>"Ermangarde, you are pale. A good tonic is what you need. Liver,</p>
<p>probably."</p>
<p>"Oh no, Mother."</p>
<p>"Nothing to be ashamed of. We all have them."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about mine, Mother."</p>
<p>"Your father used to say that, too. But I found it more expedient to</p>
<p>worry about his liver than about the execrable bad temper that could</p>
<p>result from its moodiness."</p>
<p>"Your panacea for all mortal ills, Mother, the liver its limitations."</p>
<p>"Of course. Meaning that yours is the immortal ill. I am not so</p>
<p>sure that my despised little liver pill is not best sort of cure for</p>
<p>lovesickness too. Puppy-lovesickness."</p>
<p>"Mother!"</p>
<p>"Great pouting girl like you. Why, you should be on your knees for</p>
<p>thankfulness that you found the fellow out in time. You have been</p>
<p>jilted, only you haven't the sound judgment to know it. And here you</p>
<p>are, eating out your heart because----'</p>
<p>"Mother, if you discuss it, I'll leave the house--I can't stand</p>
<p>it----"</p>
<p>"I am no more eager to discuss it than you are. But you are sallow</p>
<p>and you are enigmatic and you are dull. The few hours a day that you</p>
<p>spend at home are depressing for the entire household, and, while we</p>
<p>are on the subject, you have been seen here and there with Ewald.</p>
<p>You are meeting him in public places. Now it must stop. He's a</p>
<p>married man and was coming to this house with his wife, Helene Craig,</p>
<p>when you were in rompers. It's disgusting and vulgar, and if it</p>
<p>continues I shall call him up at his club and forbid him...."</p>
<p>The little icicle smile of Ermangarde's was out.</p>
<p>"Don't forbid any more, Mother. I wouldn't, really."</p>
<p>"You're a sour, enigmatic girl," repeated Mrs. Oessetrich. "The</p>
<p>world is yours. You have youth, wealth, and position, but instead of</p>
<p>taking advantage of your great opportunities, you sit on the edge of</p>
<p>them and mourn for the loss of something that you never owned."</p>
<p>"You mean for the loss of something that you never permitted me to</p>
<p>own, Mother."</p>
<p>"Oh, how weary I am of the exactions of my faultfinding daughters. I</p>
<p>must be younger than they, in spirit at least, because they all treat</p>
<p>me in a fashion that makes me feel juvenile and incorrigible. Family</p>
<p>ties and the vulgar wranglings of the household! I wish I were like</p>
<p>the cook in my kitchen, free to----"</p>
<p>"You couldn't be like--her, Mother."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Oh--nothing."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The war years plunged in. The city turned the sallow green of khaki.</p>
<p>Regiments poured through the streets. Flashing impersonal rows of</p>
<p>animated scissors. Farm boys with callouses deep in their hands,</p>
<p>marching off, to war on farm boys they had never seen. Great oxygen</p>
<p>tanks of patriotism, generated in a hurry, gushed out volatile and</p>
<p>inflammable from coast to coast. The phrase "Safe for Democracy"</p>
<p>began to jiggle like electric signs before bewildered eyes. Dizzy</p>
<p>with its euphony, men fell into regimental step. Thousands and</p>
<p>thousands of scissors of them. The whole thing began to swing into a</p>
<p>horrible motion like the slow acceleration of a voodoo dance.</p>
<p>Envoys crossed word-swords and all the little men began to run, and</p>
<p>the red threads of high-sounding idealisms and patriotism to come out</p>
<p>in eyeballs. The inflamed voodoo dance around the cauldron brewed on</p>
<p>the table of paternal governments began to grow....</p>
<p>That was the way the men went off to war, riveted with that paternal</p>
<p>eye and inflamed with the generated oxygen, the generated phrases,</p>
<p>and the generated idealism.</p>
<p>Sometimes they passed the house. Regiments of them. They were so</p>
<p>young. Lean flanked. Time and time again Bertha drew down the</p>
<p>sashes against their passing. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp-tramp-tramp. It</p>
<p>was a horrible rhythm. The willy-nilly young men, steaming up hate.</p>
<p>Olga was in khaki, too. It gave her the sleek flatness of a fowl.</p>
<p>Where the expensive tweeds had been clumsy, the khaki lay slick.</p>
<p>Slanting shoulders, neat at the armholes and a pat little hat. It</p>
<p>made her busy and important, all the hating. She drove a small</p>
<p>khaki-colored ambulance around town. Everywhere. She was very</p>
<p>earnest.</p>
<p>The world safe for democracy. The little women without sons began to</p>
<p>bustle so. The sudden splendidness of making the world safe for</p>
<p>democracy. It made you as important as you were in your own home, on</p>
<p>general cleaning day. Sweaters to be sorted. Chocolates to be</p>
<p>stacked in boxes and addressed for overseas. Sandwiches to be cut</p>
<p>for canteens. Chest protectors to be stitched in the name of</p>
<p>democracy.</p>
<p>Olga ran her ambulance with her lips straight and her eyes probing</p>
<p>ahead and stern. The zeal of the women. Democracy. Sandwiches to</p>
<p>be cut. Chocolates to be stacked. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp-tramp-tramp.</p>
<p>There was a portrait of Beethoven hung in the dining room.</p>
<p>"Take it down, Bertha," said Olga.</p>
<p>Paula cried, as Bertha, steadied on a ladder by Olga, unhooked it</p>
<p>from its moulding.</p>
<p>"That's absurd, Olga. What has Beethoven to do with this horrible</p>
<p>fighting?"</p>
<p>"War is war."</p>
<p>"Exactly. War is only war. A matter of nations. Art transcends</p>
<p>war. Art is the language of God and war is the barking of men.</p>
<p>Beethoven is bigger than war. Next year there may be a new war and</p>
<p>we may be in league with the very nation we are hating now. Wars</p>
<p>change. Beethoven is eternal."</p>
<p>"Easy there, Bertha. Let me hoist. There!"</p>
<p>"Olga--don't----"</p>
<p>"Paula, don't be absurd! How can I ask those boys who are going</p>
<p>overseas to walk into my mother's house with that picture hanging on</p>
<p>the wall? Have you no patriotism?"</p>
<p>"No. Not that kind."</p>
<p>"You talk like a pacifist!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps--I am."</p>
<p>"Paula!"</p>
<p>"If it means loathing war sufficiently to bear the unpleasant brunt</p>
<p>of being branded a coward, I suppose I am a pacifist. Yes, I am a</p>
<p>pacifist! I loathe all this blind rushing pell-mell into a struggle</p>
<p>arranged by the mighty minority and paid for with the lives of young</p>
<p>men who are drugged on trumped-up ideals. I loathe war which</p>
<p>destroys the internationalism of art for the puny nationalism of men.</p>
<p>The maimed bodies aren't the worst. That's the easy way to hate war.</p>
<p>The safe way. I--hate it just as much for the maimed souls that stay</p>
<p>at home--to whom the noise of military brass bands is louder than the</p>
<p>music of Beethoven."</p>
<p>"Paula, you are merely stupid and sentimental, but just the same</p>
<p>those are dangerous, disloyal utterances. You're not well. Go</p>
<p>upstairs to your music. I expect some service men here this</p>
<p>afternoon for tea and dancing in the drawing-room. Don't make me</p>
<p>ashamed to bring them into this house. Bertha, take that picture</p>
<p>upstairs into the storeroom."</p>
<p>"Olga!"</p>
<p>"Paula, I know you're not well. But please, dear, never talk like</p>
<p>that, even among ourselves. Do you realize that what you said, even</p>
<p>though it may be partially true, makes you a traitor? A traitor to</p>
<p>your country. Paula--look at me--a traitor----"</p>
<p>The word bit in like a little asp. All the way up to the storeroom,</p>
<p>slanting the picture along the narrow stairways, it stung across</p>
<p>Bertha's silence.</p>
<p>Paula, who loved Beethoven and wept his lyricism softly along the</p>
<p>keys. Paula, who loved Beethoven more than she could hate anything</p>
<p>or anybody. Paula a traitor?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Barney, the private night watchman, liked Helga. You knew it by her</p>
<p>new slanting and birdwise look. For a long time there had been</p>
<p>something shy about her. New silences. She was sweeter about the</p>
<p>dull evenings tucked up there under the slant of roof. Sometimes she</p>
<p>sewed and smiled or, if Paula was playing, let her head fall back</p>
<p>against the chair and her mouth drop open softly. On warm nights,</p>
<p>she stole out on the rear stoop for whispering moments with Barney as</p>
<p>he passed on his rounds, and on snowy nights, the kitchen range was</p>
<p>kept banked a little more than usual. But even after she had gone</p>
<p>upstairs for the bit of sewing or to lie back lulled to the weaving</p>
<p>of Paula's music, she always slid forward a bit on her chair to the</p>
<p>knocking of the night stick. One. Two. Three. Slid forward with</p>
<p>the lifted, eager look. Then Bertha knew. The silences were so</p>
<p>telltale. Helga, who could suddenly sit neat-lipped and rather</p>
<p>inscrutable all evening, and then wear the little smile to bed. It</p>
<p>was hard not to tremble for that smile. You trembled more for it</p>
<p>than for the garrulous bitterness.</p>
<p>Only once in a while there was a flash in the pan of the old Helga.</p>
<p>In winter she had to snatch her visits with Barney, whispering with</p>
<p>him in the kitchen, the ugly gray dish cloth drying across the pan</p>
<p>and the great blob of brown soap still soft and smelling from riding</p>
<p>greasy water.</p>
<p>"Having to sit company with a fellow like Barney in somebody's</p>
<p>kitchen! There never was a girl didn't want a place where she could</p>
<p>punch up a few sofa pillows and turn on a pink lamp. A</p>
<p>self-respecting man like Barney, and me with no place to entertain</p>
<p>him but next to the kitchen sink. A real honest-to-goodness man like</p>
<p>him."</p>
<p>Barney was like that. Honest to goodness. A scrub of rough red</p>
<p>Irish hair. Enormous hands that fiddled with his hat. Bright blue</p>
<p>eyes with wrinkled lids that he batted for all he was worth, and when</p>
<p>he laughed his entire face focused in toward the center, until it</p>
<p>looked like a shirred rosette.</p>
<p>And Barney could make Helga laugh. Jerky, immature laughter and one</p>
<p>night, when she had her head thrown back in merriment at one of his</p>
<p>slow overgrown antics, he put out a shy big hand and touched her</p>
<p>softly on the neck where it arched.</p>
<p>"You're like a little bird, there," he said.</p>
<p>She was broody after that and Bertha found her crying the next</p>
<p>morning, because Mrs. Oessetrich had her at cleaning some high and</p>
<p>difficult pantry shelves that aggravated the chronic pain she had in</p>
<p>her side, and Bertha did them for her and later that same day she</p>
<p>cried because she broke a porcelain bowl and Bertha took that brunt</p>
<p>for her and that evening, upstairs in the pocket of the fourth floor</p>
<p>back room, she broke out.</p>
<p>"Barney--likes--me."</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"What do you think he says to me the other night, Bertha, and touched</p>
<p>me here--soft on my neck. 'You're like a little bird there'--I likta</p>
<p>died, I wish I hadda----."</p>
<p>"Helga----."</p>
<p>"He's got an old woman. His mother. Eighty-eight. Keeps house for</p>
<p>him. I know what's in the back of his head same as if I could see</p>
<p>in. He don't come out and say it, but he keeps hinting. Wants to</p>
<p>take me there. Wants his old woman to see me before she passes on.</p>
<p>The way he said that one thing to me. 'You're like a little bird</p>
<p>there.' I likta died. I wish I hadda----"</p>
<p>"No--no----"</p>
<p>"Yes! I could land Barney. He's just waiting until his old woman</p>
<p>passes on. I could land him, but I wouldn't! A man like Barney to</p>
<p>happen to me. Got him hook and bait. And what do I do? Unhook him</p>
<p>and throw him back into the pond. That's being white, ain't it,</p>
<p>Bertha?</p>
<p>"Yes--Helga----"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The boys kept marching. You had to stop at street corners to let</p>
<p>them tramp past. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp-tramp-tramp.</p>
<p>You scrubbed floors to that rhythm. You breathed in your sleep to</p>
<p>it. And the boys with the wide clean faces and the calloused hands</p>
<p>stalked and stalked, made drunk with the sudden ecstasy of being a</p>
<p>foe. It made the leap in the dark a thing of glory ... that spat of</p>
<p>shot ... across the eyes....</p>
<p>Every week Olga held canteen in her mother's gold and brocade</p>
<p>drawing-room. Rugs were dragged back. Furniture stacked, planks</p>
<p>spread from chair-back to chair-back and then piled with pyramids of</p>
<p>sandwiches and mounds of salad stuck all over with small American</p>
<p>flags. There was a victrola for dancing.</p>
<p>Helga could carve charming sandwiches. Little hearts and spades and</p>
<p>diamond-shaped ones made in layers. The boys gobbled them at one</p>
<p>mouthful. But sometimes, when the pain in her side was gnawing from</p>
<p>the hours of slicing and buttering and stacking, she made plain,</p>
<p>square, ragged ones and Olga was cross.</p>
<p>Olga! Life spun for her those war months and for the little group of</p>
<p>drab-clad girls who came to help on canteen days. The eager, hating</p>
<p>girls. It was thrilling to hate! Thrilling to feed these</p>
<p>wide-faced, clean-faced boys the catnip. It made them heroic and gay</p>
<p>and debonair and careless, and full of a very fine fervor for</p>
<p>fighting that foe unknown and that foe unseen. It made the fine,</p>
<p>high-sounding war phrases shine.</p>
<p>It was easier somehow to hate, and to want to fight, with all of the</p>
<p>machinery for making the world safe for democracy so busily in</p>
<p>motion. The making of the gas masks. The measuring of the chest</p>
<p>expansion. The cutting of the sandwiches. The wearing of the</p>
<p>puttees.</p>
<p>If you were a farm hand with those hands still callous from the plow,</p>
<p>and every night had slept in the socks and under-drawers that you</p>
<p>worked in by day, and all your youth had flung forkfuls of fertilizer</p>
<p>out over fields and spat in ditches while you dug them, oh it was</p>
<p>stirring and exciting suddenly to be fed the heart-shaped sandwiches,</p>
<p>one to a bite, and to be danced with by all the Olgas, whose hands</p>
<p>were white caresses and whose eyes adored. It made you long for a</p>
<p>thousand thousand foes and a thousand thousand hates.</p>
<p>Busy days for Olga and the thousands of eager girls in the service,</p>
<p>who were wearing becoming khaki and beating the tom-tom of the war</p>
<p>dance.</p>
<p>Sixteen months of it and on the seventeenth Olga, her eyes high with</p>
<p>strange new fires, sailed on a transport.</p>
<p>It was all very simple. She bounced in one day with a jangle of the</p>
<p>keys to her studio, while Mrs. Oessetrich and Paula were at lunch. A</p>
<p>solemn little meal. Mrs. Oessetrich, with the editorial page of the</p>
<p>morning _Times_ propped up against her tumbler, and eating, in her</p>
<p>pecksniffy fashion, short quick forkfuls of an _omelette soufflé_.</p>
<p>Paula, whose blue eyes were so languid, almost a little stagnant now,</p>
<p>as if something in them had jammed and could not seem to flow on.</p>
<p>"Well, 'Tilda, I've popped in for good-bys. We're sailing sometime</p>
<p>between now and midnight."</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich swallowed her portion of omelet, and brushed her</p>
<p>mouth with her napkin as a man would. Two ways.</p>
<p>"Well, that's that," she said, and pushed back from the table.</p>
<p>"That's that, Mrs. Oessetrich," repeated Olga, and smiled at her with</p>
<p>the eyes with the bonfires in them and whipped a cigarette out of a</p>
<p>soft pack of them in her khaki pocket and drew up a chair beside the</p>
<p>table and crossed her long legs and drew a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>"Have some lunch?"</p>
<p>"No thanks, Mother."</p>
<p>"Umph."</p>
<p>"Say, Mother, I think you're immense." Olga's eyes were round when</p>
<p>she said that, with cockatoo rims to them exactly like Mrs.</p>
<p>Oessetrich's. They made her very much her mother's daughter.</p>
<p>"I suppose you feared a sloppy mess. Well don't worry, if I have</p>
<p>tears to shed I won't prepare to shed them now."</p>
<p>"I'll write often."</p>
<p>"I suppose this is where I should break in with the usual</p>
<p>instructions from moron mothers to moron offspring. 'Keep your feet</p>
<p>dry.'"</p>
<p>"Don't you love it, Paula? Isn't she great?"</p>
<p>"And there is no use crossing a submarine until you come to it."</p>
<p>"Here's the key to the studio, 'Tilda. You won't mind, dear, keeping</p>
<p>the lease for me. It's only a hundred a month."</p>
<p>"I hate waste."</p>
<p>"I know, dear, but it's such a mess, subletting."</p>
<p>"Very well. Give me the keys."</p>
<p>"Where's Ermangarde?"</p>
<p>"Out."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Take good care of yourself, Paula. Now--now--please--no waterworks!"</p>
<p>"You know--my sentiments--Olga----."</p>
<p>"Yes, and the true pacifist drops his lamb's clothing in time of war."</p>
<p>"Not the true one. The weak one. He drops it because it is so much</p>
<p>easier to fight than not to fight----"</p>
<p>"You're sick, darling. Take care of her, 'Tilda. Good-by, Helga.</p>
<p>See that you don't elope with Barney before I get back and don't be a</p>
<p>sly one and shove off all your chores on to Bertha. We know your</p>
<p>system."</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich stood up very straight, as if there were a rod up her</p>
<p>back, and her eyes were sharp and darting and as dry as shoe buttons.</p>
<p>"Hurry, girl."</p>
<p>"Good-by, Bertha, you old Rock of Gibraltar. It helps somehow,</p>
<p>knowing you're here--on the job. You--whoever you are--so long--old</p>
<p>Bertha."</p>
<p>"Good-by--Miss Olga."</p>
<p>"Well, Mathilde, Paula--old dears--tell Ermie good-by and to cut out</p>
<p>the Ewald nonsense. It's disgusting. My bags are out in the taxi.</p>
<p>The meter will click me out of house and home. So long, dears.</p>
<p>Everybody. You know the address. American Expeditionary Forces.</p>
<p>Paris--S'long...."</p>
<p>It was very silent, and for every mouthful of tea poor Paula</p>
<p>swallowed a great vein came out in her neck. Her omelet and</p>
<p>editorial finished, Mrs. Oessetrich rose and following her custom,</p>
<p>carried the few crumbs in her lap into the conservatory to shake them</p>
<p>into the aquarium.</p>
<p>"Order the car for three, Bertha."</p>
<p>But it was almost five when Mrs. Oessetrich emerged finally from her</p>
<p>room. Eddie started up from a doze at the wheel as she swept out.</p>
<p>"Where, Madam?"</p>
<p>"Oh--why--just drive."</p>
<p>Her eyes were very shiny and the cockatoo rims quite pink. And</p>
<p>Bertha had to run out after her with her handkerchief, which she had</p>
<p>forgotten.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ermangarde had not returned by nine that evening, but a messenger</p>
<p>brought a letter. Bertha carried it into Mrs. Oessetrich, who was</p>
<p>sitting alone in the drawing-room, tapping her foot. The high</p>
<p>chandelier flooded the room through crystal. Once in a while a prism</p>
<p>clicked.</p>
<p>"For me?"</p>
<p>"Yah--a letter."</p>
<p>"_Dear Mother_," it read, "_by the time you receive this note Ewald</p>
<p>and I will be on a steamer bound for somewhere sunny. There is</p>
<p>nothing to feel concerned about. We are very happy and are going</p>
<p>into this thing with our eyes open._</p>
<p>"_Ermangarde._"</p>
<p>The old, the terrible, the shoe button eyes of Mrs. Oessetrich. When</p>
<p>she raised them to Bertha, they lay shattered in her head, broken</p>
<p>there as if they had been drilled through and had cracked in a</p>
<p>thousand directions.</p>
<p>"Bertha--Bertha--lend me your strength--Bertha--you--where----"</p>
<p>She fainted out stiffly, like a doll. To revive her, you held her</p>
<p>very closely and very warmly to your heart, until its beating seemed</p>
<p>to beat into her.</p>
<p>The house stood in a great silent yawn. You found yourself tiptoeing</p>
<p>through the halls, and the front shades had not been raised, except</p>
<p>for general cleaning, in months. Paula played a great deal, but in</p>
<p>the whispering fashion, so that if you took your pan of potatoes up</p>
<p>to the top of the back stairs and sat there in the gloom to peel</p>
<p>them, and to listen, half the time all you heard was the little sing</p>
<p>to the silence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich drove Olga's little fawn-colored ambulance now. She</p>
<p>wore the khaki-colored uniform, too, only where Olga had looked</p>
<p>jaunty, she looked stocky. Her waist curved in so and the jacket</p>
<p>strained at the armholes. The natty little service hat, too, sat up</p>
<p>too high on her head. You suspected some sort of an elastic-band</p>
<p>attachment so that if she attempted to remove it, pop, it would snap</p>
<p>back like a vaudeville comedian's.</p>
<p>She drove like one possessed. Meeting transports. Carrying</p>
<p>supplies. Skiddering across the city at all hours on all missions.</p>
<p>The von Schlegels still came to occasional dinners and Madam</p>
<p>Gerbhardt rather forlornly, with Ermangarde absent, for Saturday</p>
<p>luncheon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich dined in uniform. Sometimes a summons came and she</p>
<p>rushed off during the meal. There was never a moment of the day that</p>
<p>found her passive. She tore ahead of the hours as if they were</p>
<p>wolves and their breathing was on her neck, and all day long the</p>
<p>relentless jangle jangle of her at the telephone. It ran along your</p>
<p>nerves. It pricked you into a frenzy. Jangle. Jangle.</p>
<p>"_Hello, Bertha. I'm at a pier in Hoboken. Tell Helga I want the</p>
<p>pair of Sevres urns in the drawing-room washed in warm suds and</p>
<p>polished. And don't let me discover that you have done it for her.</p>
<p>If--if that letter--or cable--if anything that looks like a message</p>
<p>from Miss Ermangarde should come, you can reach me in the next hour</p>
<p>at the Service Station--no, never mind, I'll call up again._"</p>
<p>But that letter or cablegram never came.</p>
<p>More and more the lean, quick, waiting look of a bird came out in</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich and more and more, Paula, who drifted, almost it</p>
<p>seemed without footsteps, down to her meals and then back again to</p>
<p>her piano and the soft silent sewing of the pink things, came to have</p>
<p>the look of sleeping with her eyes wide open, and more and more</p>
<p>frequently her mother shot out at her with the "Paula, wake up.</p>
<p>Don't stare that way. It makes you look positively silly."</p>
<p>Then one day Bertha stumbled across her in the musty store-room,</p>
<p>seated on the floor beside the Beethoven picture, twaddling over it.</p>
<p>Poor Paula, her eyes had the tranced look and she was whispering to</p>
<p>it, a little sillily.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The way that Helga happened to break one of the beautiful Sevres urns</p>
<p>the day she was put to rinsing them was because in the very act of</p>
<p>lifting it from its pedestal, she fell screaming and twisting with</p>
<p>the pain in her side. There seemed to be no way to unlock her of the</p>
<p>rigid convulsion there on the floor. Paula came creeping down to her</p>
<p>cries and could only stand horrified. Helga writhing on the floor</p>
<p>and beating off Bertha. Finally, there was nothing left to do but</p>
<p>call in the nearest doctor. At five o'clock Helga was bundled off to</p>
<p>a public hospital in an ambulance. At six she was successfully</p>
<p>operated upon for appendicitis.</p>
<p>It was strange being up there alone again in the room under the</p>
<p>rafters. The silence flowed back and all the little sounds and sings</p>
<p>and noises stole out of their corners and seemed to sit about like</p>
<p>tame mice on their haunches.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Helga lay in a ward, but there was a screen around her cot and a</p>
<p>bride had sent her altar flowers to be distributed in the hospital,</p>
<p>and there was a fan of white hyacinth on a table, and the afternoon</p>
<p>that Mrs. Oessetrich and Paula came, they brought the inevitable and</p>
<p>innocuous jar of calves' foot jelly, and that glowed like a drug</p>
<p>store urn on the snowlit window sill.</p>
<p>The pretty Helga. Two days after the operation her cheeks began to</p>
<p>pinken and the nurse brushed and braided her brown hair over each</p>
<p>shoulder and out came the frail, fine, small-boned look.</p>
<p>She loved the warm, clean cot and the smell of hyacinth even through</p>
<p>the iodoform and the luxury of waking only to coddle over again</p>
<p>cozily on her good side, and when Bertha came to see her and remained</p>
<p>all of Thursday afternoon, she had the proprietary air of the</p>
<p>convalescent.</p>
<p>"See that good-looking fellow in glasses? He's my doctor. I'd give</p>
<p>a dime to know if he's married. Say, look around the screen at that</p>
<p>little blonde one three cots down. The one with the green circles</p>
<p>under her eyes. That kid--poor kid--what does she do? Getting over</p>
<p>an appendix and spry as I am. Nothing to get well for. Cries out</p>
<p>some fellow's name all through the ether. What does she do? Last</p>
<p>night while the nurse wasn't looking, climbs out barefoot on that</p>
<p>little balcony, gives herself a snow bath and swallows a pneumonia</p>
<p>bug or two. Dyin'. Say, it's a great life. See that ell over</p>
<p>there. Maternity ward. Kid born there fresh every hour. Ought to</p>
<p>see. Ever see a maternity ward?"</p>
<p>"Me--yah----"</p>
<p>"The interne, he's a little gone on me if anybody should ask you. He</p>
<p>lugged one over to-day for me to see. Three hours old. Ever see a</p>
<p>little hard-boiled beet of a kid three hours old?"</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"I want a white one. White as my hands. Look at them, Bertha.</p>
<p>Three days in bed and that snow out there on the balcony has nothing</p>
<p>on them for whiteness. You don't mind yours that way, do you,</p>
<p>Bertha?"</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Horny."</p>
<p>"Horny?"</p>
<p>"You're like one of those war tanks, you are. Pushing right on over</p>
<p>the barbed wire fences without letting them even scratch you. That's</p>
<p>because you're all on the inside of yourself. Like your body was</p>
<p>just an ulster."</p>
<p>"Don't roll so, Helga. The wound...."</p>
<p>"That ain't the worst. I got what they call on the soap box speeches</p>
<p>in Union Square, a social sore. And they bring me calves' foot jelly</p>
<p>for it. There's a laugh for you, old tombstone! I got a social sore</p>
<p>and they bring me calves' foot jelly for it...."</p>
<p>But the following Sunday when Bertha arrived she was a very subdued</p>
<p>Helga.</p>
<p>"He's coming at four."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Barney. I didn't ask him, Bertha. Didn't even know he knew I was</p>
<p>here. I got a postal. You must have told him."</p>
<p>"He kept asking."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have sent for him. If his old woman was to pass on</p>
<p>to-morrow and--and he wanted me, I'd never do it to him--that's</p>
<p>something, ain't it, Bertha? I want him. I could have him. He</p>
<p>would never find out. He wouldn't understand if I tried to tell him.</p>
<p>To him fire don't cleanse--it only scars after you've been through</p>
<p>it."</p>
<p>"Yah. Barney is not a wise man. He is yoost a--good man----"</p>
<p>"That just about says it."</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"What are you staring at?"</p>
<p>"I--why you, Helga. You're pretty."</p>
<p>"This nightgown. So coarse! I'm a fright in it. They give them to</p>
<p>you like that in the wards. Ugh--and him coming at four.</p>
<p>Bertha--would you----"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"It's a long trip back to the house, but up in our room, there's a</p>
<p>box of some of my little things. I keep it hid. There's no telling</p>
<p>when a girl's room can get pried into. There's a little box of my</p>
<p>things up on top of the wardrobe. You can reach up and feel for it</p>
<p>if you get on a chair. He's--coming at four."</p>
<p>"But Helga, I thought----"</p>
<p>"I want to deck myself out, so anyways he'll know what he's</p>
<p>missing--I hate him seeing me like this. All he's ever seen of me is</p>
<p>around ugly kitchen things, in ugly kitchen duds. Bertha--if I could</p>
<p>just have those few things to deck myself out in when Barney comes.</p>
<p>As long as he's going to lose me, he might as well think I'm worth</p>
<p>losing. Will you go--Bertha--will you----?"</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>The package was behind the wooden frill of the wardrobe. Reaching</p>
<p>for it was a difficult tiptoe process that made the chair wobble, and</p>
<p>a shower of old dust came down on the shoulders of Bertha's reefer.</p>
<p>Hurrying down the steep rear staircase, Mrs. Oessetrich popped out a</p>
<p>sudden head.</p>
<p>"That you, Bertha?"</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"I thought you were gone for the afternoon."</p>
<p>"I came back for a minute."</p>
<p>"Did you go to see Helga?"</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"How is she?"</p>
<p>"Better."</p>
<p>"Do you think she will be well in time to be back for the dinner to</p>
<p>my Ambulance Corps? It's a great nuisance getting help from the</p>
<p>agencies."</p>
<p>"Yah--maybe----"</p>
<p>"You are going out again?"</p>
<p>"Yah--I----"</p>
<p>"Of course, it's your afternoon, but the von Schlegels are coming to</p>
<p>tea and it would help if you would stay in and----"</p>
<p>"I cannot--to-day----."</p>
<p>"Oh very well. I dislike asking favors as much as I dislike being</p>
<p>denied them. What's that you are carrying?"</p>
<p>"A box."</p>
<p>"That is rather self-evident, but what is in it?"</p>
<p>"Some--oh--I don't know."</p>
<p>"Bertha, I have never known you to be impertinent."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Oessetrich, I am not."</p>
<p>"Very well. If you prefer not to tell me I suppose that technically</p>
<p>it is none of my affair. But even with a trusted servant I cannot</p>
<p>seem to get over my aversion to seeing packages carted out of my</p>
<p>house. Of course with you it's different, but just the same I</p>
<p>dislike it. Hurry along, then."</p>
<p>For some reason, taking that long crosstown walk back to the Tenth</p>
<p>Avenue Hospital, Bertha's cheeks and eyeballs and the hand that</p>
<p>clutched the box began to burn.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Helga's eyes were too bright. She threw herself about the cot while</p>
<p>she waited and when Bertha returned, she was all thumbs at the</p>
<p>package and when the knot would not untie, she lay back against the</p>
<p>pillow and began to cry.</p>
<p>"I'm too weak. Help me, Bertha. I give myself the cotton-flannel</p>
<p>horrors in this hospital sack. Fortheluvvaga don't stand gaping.</p>
<p>It's only silk and it won't bite."</p>
<p>"Helga!"</p>
<p>"Helga what? Helga what?"</p>
<p>There was nothing to do then but to lift out the filmy white crepe</p>
<p>gown with the rill of French Valenciennes, and slide it on to Helga.</p>
<p>She came up out of it like a flower, her neck and arms suddenly</p>
<p>lovely under the shy mesh of the lace. There was another gown just</p>
<p>as sheer in the box and oddments and ends of ribbon and trinkety bits</p>
<p>of jewelry, and the nurse helped, too, and tied a bandeau of ribbon</p>
<p>on Helga's hair and fluffed up the pillows and finally there was</p>
<p>something very doll-like about her as she lay back tiredly.</p>
<p>"Dig down in the corner of the box there, Bertha, right-hand corner,</p>
<p>there's a little rose quartz pin will look sweet on this lace. If</p>
<p>there's one thing I love it's rose quartz, it's the color of a girl's</p>
<p>cheeks."</p>
<p>"Oh, Helga--Helga----"</p>
<p>"'Oh Helga, Helga' what? I know what you're thinking. Well you're</p>
<p>wrong. Maybe this stuff of mine dates back to--well, you know the</p>
<p>days it dates back to--and maybe you don't. And what if what you are</p>
<p>thinking is right? Well, what if it is? McMurty----"</p>
<p>"I--don't know--what I'm thinking, Helga."</p>
<p>"I want him to see me once, the color of something lovely instead of</p>
<p>something reeking of brown soap. Give me that rose quartz. It's the</p>
<p>color of a girl's cheeks and that's the color Barney's entitled to."</p>
<p>Barney came. He was shy about coming around the cot-side of the</p>
<p>screen and stood outside twirling his hat until the nurse, who had</p>
<p>directed him, had to come all the way down the ward again and steer</p>
<p>him in, and even then he could not be brought to approach the cot,</p>
<p>advancing one step and retreating two, his great figure in bulky</p>
<p>civilian clothing, exhaling the cold snow smell of outdoors. The red</p>
<p>of his face ran up under the red of his hair and mustache. He jutted</p>
<p>it out fiercely and then sucked it in again.</p>
<p>"Look, Bertha, he's scared of me."</p>
<p>Persiflage and poor Barney. It fuddled him and made him blink.</p>
<p>"Look, Bertha, he's afraid I'm a doll in a box."</p>
<p>"It's snowing for proper," he said. "Just came up now in a flurry."</p>
<p>He had a voice that shook things when he spoke. The spoon in the</p>
<p>medicine glass trembled. Helga laughed at it and cried right into</p>
<p>the laugh and licked off a tear with the little pink adder of her</p>
<p>tongue.</p>
<p>"Howdy--Barney."</p>
<p>"You _do_ look like a doll in the box--laying there."</p>
<p>"I'll be going," said Bertha.</p>
<p>"Don't you be going," he said, "We'll be wanting you," and sat down</p>
<p>in the creaky edge of a chair there beside the cot and drew off his</p>
<p>leather mitts and unwound his muffler and blew on his hands. And</p>
<p>blew and blew.</p>
<p>"You're better, ain't you, Helga?"</p>
<p>She raised her bare arm in a half wreath over her head.</p>
<p>"Lots you care."</p>
<p>He blew and he blew.</p>
<p>"I couldn't come before, Helga. I been in trouble. Sit down,</p>
<p>Bertha, we'll be needing you. My old woman died, Helga. Dead and</p>
<p>buried this day week."</p>
<p>"I better be going," said Bertha.</p>
<p>"Wait, you, Big One. You know how to help...."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He leaned over to touch Helga shyly, where her throat throbbed.</p>
<p>"I want to carry her off from here. Home. There's bedside weddings.</p>
<p>I've read of a many of them. To-morrow, Bertha, we'll do the</p>
<p>fixings. Helga?"</p>
<p>Helga lay so white and still. You could almost see the heart of her</p>
<p>seem to stir the rill of the Valenciennes. And her eyes were closed</p>
<p>and the brown braids lay in ropes against her pallor.</p>
<p>"Helga?"</p>
<p>"I better be going," said Bertha.</p>
<p>Outside it was snowing in sudden loose flakes that spat you roundly</p>
<p>on the cheek. It snowed up in merry little geysers. Slantwise and</p>
<p>down your neck. The whole street blew forward like the frilled</p>
<p>petticoat of a frantic lady. Your hat. Your heart. Your breathing.</p>
<p>The wind lashed at them so and froze the tears to your cheeks....</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Something had happened. The screen stood huddled closely about the</p>
<p>cot. A white interne came out with a tank. Oxygen. An electric</p>
<p>bulb on a flexible stand was bent away from the bed, so that its</p>
<p>light flowed down into a pool on the floor. There was a cruel</p>
<p>rasping noise against the grain of the silence. It made you cold all</p>
<p>over like the jerking back of a hangnail against the direction of the</p>
<p>flesh. You stood outside the screen and listened and trembled. The</p>
<p>noise was Helga, breathing.</p>
<p>There was something on the chair. It rose and fell. It was Barney's</p>
<p>back as he sat by the cot side, all curved forward with his great</p>
<p>empty hands between his knees and his eyes like empty cups.</p>
<p>The pink was gone from Helga's face. It was as if some one had held</p>
<p>up a transparent finger before a candle and then blown out the flame.</p>
<p>The laxness of the hand. It hung down like a lily on a broken stalk.</p>
<p>After a time the dead old eyes of Barney swung toward the drift of</p>
<p>hand. But without seeing. He only looked. Crowded hurting corner,</p>
<p>filled with the little gale of Helga's breathing. The curve of</p>
<p>Barney. That twisted neck of the lamp and the bulb that glared to</p>
<p>the floor.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said Bertha.</p>
<p>"Pneumonia," said the nurse, and put Helga's hand back under the</p>
<p>coverlet as you would a flower or a letter.</p>
<p>"Oh--Helga."</p>
<p>"She was coming along so nicely. She must have become delirious</p>
<p>suddenly during the night. The second case of the kind in this ward</p>
<p>in one week. They found her out there in that little balcony</p>
<p>standing in the snow. Just in her flimsy nightdress. Barefoot. She</p>
<p>must have been very sly about it. The night nurse had scarcely</p>
<p>turned her back. I've never had a patient do it on me. Let me touch</p>
<p>wood. Of course, they all say that I'm not only careful, I'm</p>
<p>fanatical. It's double pneumonia. Of course some do rally,</p>
<p>but--poor child--you're her nearest relative--or friend----."</p>
<p>"Me? Yes, I guess."</p>
<p>"You can stay and wait if you want."</p>
<p>"Yah--please."</p>
<p>"Has she ever been a mental case?"</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"A nervous history, I mean."</p>
<p>"Why I--dunno."</p>
<p>"It must have been sudden insanity or hysteria caused her to find her</p>
<p>way out to that balcony. Second case in one week. I always say ward</p>
<p>patients should be kept in ignorance of such accidents. Dangers of</p>
<p>auto-suggestion."</p>
<p>"Oh, Helga--Helga----"</p>
<p>The white rose leaves of Helga's eyelids. One of them seemed to</p>
<p>Bertha to crinkle at one corner.</p>
<p>Barney beat his big hands loosely together as they hung between his</p>
<p>knees. His big hands. His empty hands.</p>
<p>She seemed to know with her smile that he was there. It lit once</p>
<p>toward him and she tried to reach out her hand, but it just drifted</p>
<p>along the bedside and hung loose, and he kissed it and put it back</p>
<p>under the coverlet as if it were a small dead bird.</p>
<p>"Oh God," cried Barney in his voice that seemed to have the mustache</p>
<p>growing right on it. "There's no meaning to your wisdom. That talk</p>
<p>is bunk."</p>
<p>"Yes, there is--meaning--somewhere----"</p>
<p>"To you maybe, Big One, but not to me...."</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>At dawn Helga began to slip away. She tried to keep the little</p>
<p>thread of the smile on her lips but such a foolish sniveling thing</p>
<p>was happening.</p>
<p>The years were like water surging her backward.</p>
<p>It was at Mrs. Farley's and she was coming down one cold morning,</p>
<p>adjusting the criss-cross straps to her apron and tasting her lips as</p>
<p>if they were bitter.</p>
<p>"Fortheluvvaga" was the last thing Helga said before she died.</p>
<p>"Warmed-over oatmeal again. This oleo is strong enough to walk.</p>
<p>Give me a snack of little Lord Fauntrollo's sweet butter--Bertha----"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The boys kept marching. Barney, who was forty, came to say good-by.</p>
<p>It was odd to see him. Barney, who was forever bringing all the</p>
<p>stray cats on his beat to the back-door for the leavings. Sometimes</p>
<p>there were three or four of them standing around him, with hopeful</p>
<p>vertical tails and meouwing up into his face. His brick-red, open</p>
<p>fireplace of a face. Barney, all bristling now with new phrases</p>
<p>which he wore as cockily as his puttees. "To hell with the Kaiser.</p>
<p>Dirty Huns."</p>
<p>To hate was not so different from to love. Barney had discovered</p>
<p>that. Only it was difficult to steam up the hate. Tramp. Tramp.</p>
<p>Tramp-tramp-tramp. It was strange to see him with his fine square</p>
<p>back and the curving seams, walking off down the street after the</p>
<p>good-by. His shoulders were very ferocious looking and pedestrians</p>
<p>made little respectful detours to pass him. Barney, fine and fighty</p>
<p>and hating enough to be patriotic.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even Bertha bought a Liberty Bond. When Mrs. Oessetrich was not</p>
<p>driving the ambulance she stood on the steps of the Treasury Building</p>
<p>or the Public Library and sold Liberty Bonds and collected Red Cross</p>
<p>funds. A stretcher was laid along the sidewalk. The money rained</p>
<p>down on it. Give. Give. More stretchers for more maimed bodies.</p>
<p>And the frightening part of it was that you gave. Gave because the</p>
<p>piece of cheesecloth bunting snapping in the breeze made your eyes</p>
<p>hot and your heart hot. Bertha gave. It was hard for her to pass</p>
<p>one of the stretcher things and not drop a coin. The terrible</p>
<p>futility of those marching little scissors-like men. You knew it</p>
<p>deep down in your heart and hated the hating.</p>
<p>Bertha could sometimes sit upstairs in her room, big and bitter and</p>
<p>inarticulate with it. Paula, who never played any more, since the</p>
<p>Beethoven. Olga, gorging the little scissors men with the aniseed</p>
<p>cakes of stultification. Barney, who was tender to kittens, marching</p>
<p>away with the places for cartridges corrugated along his belt. Mrs.</p>
<p>Oessetrich baiting in the public square. And yet the bunting. It</p>
<p>made your tonsils tighten. So hating the hate, Bertha gave. Dropped</p>
<p>the twenty-five cent pieces on to the stretchers, that there might be</p>
<p>more stretchers, and bought a one-hundred-dollar Liberty Bond.</p>
<p>Bertha with her Liberty Bond. It was engraved on tough beautiful</p>
<p>paper and scrolled like a bank note. Sometimes she sat and looked at</p>
<p>it with her lips a little finicky and folded back from her white</p>
<p>square teeth. A wise old Chinese smile. Even the delirious, banging</p>
<p>day of the Armistice the smile persisted. The faces of all the</p>
<p>little hurrying, scurrying people were so merely guzzled. So merely</p>
<p>victorious. An oppressor had been laid. But somehow you trembled.</p>
<p>Old hates for new....</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was no evading it. Paula's queerness. For two weeks there had</p>
<p>been no way to induce her to leave the fourth-floor room. She clung</p>
<p>to it like a bit of ash blonde moss. It seemed to embarrass Mrs.</p>
<p>Oessetrich, this timid, this astonishing, this not quite rational</p>
<p>tenacity of Paula's. She hated even Bertha's knowing it and what</p>
<p>went on between mother and daughter usually happened behind closed</p>
<p>doors. Paula sat on her little sewing-chair and just faced her</p>
<p>parent when she coaxed and cajoled and threatened, and would not be</p>
<p>pried out. It was dreadful for Mrs. Oessetrich. Placed her rather</p>
<p>in the position of luring a wild bird out of ambush with crumbs.</p>
<p>Once she even tried to force her, but Paula's teeth went together</p>
<p>with a click and her fingers clenched down around the seat of the</p>
<p>chair, and frail little Paula, who looked as if Fra Lippo Lippi had</p>
<p>painted her; frail Paula who loved Chopin and the miniature melodies</p>
<p>of Mozart, there was no budging her. Not so much as an inch. She</p>
<p>gritted her teeth and sat. Just sat.</p>
<p>Bertha used to tiptoe in with her meals. She would eat for Bertha.</p>
<p>But sometimes it took an hour. Spoonful by spoonful of the broths</p>
<p>that were tilted up against her teeth, and then the slow difficult</p>
<p>gulps of muffin or of shredded meat. They were the hardest. She had</p>
<p>a way of looking at Bertha over the top of the spoon. Those eyes</p>
<p>would hang in Bertha's darkness. Disks of hot blue light.</p>
<p>Something of a sequence was taking place in Paula's aching brain.</p>
<p>That was the plain fact that was so embarrassing to her mother.</p>
<p>First the trousseau things. Then the yards of maline veiling which</p>
<p>she would pin to her hair and let trail off behind. Mrs. Oessetrich</p>
<p>burned the veil one night in the furnace so that the house smelled</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>And now Paula's sewings for the hours and hours in the little chair</p>
<p>were all doll size. Baby things. It made the red fly up into Mrs.</p>
<p>Oessetrich's face, and behind the carefully locked door, she went</p>
<p>into long, low-voiced pleading conferences with Paula.</p>
<p>But it was no use. The piano remained closed and day after day Paula</p>
<p>sat and sewed the small things.</p>
<p>Dr. Ehrenfest came. She only laughed at him, her large blue eyes</p>
<p>seeming almost to cover her face and at the slightest approach in her</p>
<p>direction, her hands locking down over the sides of the chair.</p>
<p>Down in the drawing-room, over the tea things that Bertha was</p>
<p>spreading, Dr. Ehrenfest kept stroking his slim point of beard.</p>
<p>"Well, 'Tilda, let us face our facts."</p>
<p>"I have never been the one to dodge them, Ehrey."</p>
<p>"I think the only thing to do right now is to call in Lauer on this</p>
<p>case."</p>
<p>"Dr. Emil Lauer the--the----."</p>
<p>"Yes. The neurologist."</p>
<p>"Then Paula is----."</p>
<p>"It may be only a temporary neurosis. But right now, Lauer is our</p>
<p>man. He has that splendid place out at Hill's End. It may be just</p>
<p>what Paula needs."</p>
<p>"You mean----"</p>
<p>"His sanitarium. I consider it one of the best in the country."</p>
<p>"Don't mince words with me, Ehrey. Dr. Lauer's place is a private</p>
<p>asylum."</p>
<p>"I can't see that calling a spade a bludgeon helps matters."</p>
<p>"I hate minced facts. I can swallow my dose undiluted."</p>
<p>"Well, then, I want a psychopathist like Lauer in on Paula's case."</p>
<p>"All right. All right. I'll have another lump, Bertha. All right."</p>
<p>But her face seemed to shrink, the cheeks to recede, leaving the</p>
<p>frontal part with its avian thrust even more leanly forward.</p>
<p>"I've seen it coming. 'Tilda, since----"</p>
<p>"Since Harrison, of course, you mean."</p>
<p>"You cannot suppress every normal instinct in a high-strung girl like</p>
<p>Paula and expect----"</p>
<p>"Harrison was not the man for her. He proved it by what happened</p>
<p>subsequently."</p>
<p>"What happened subsequently might not have occurred if----"</p>
<p>"Suppressed desires, Freudian pish. Paula has been indulged in every</p>
<p>possible manner except in the case of Harrison Gage."</p>
<p>"She pleaded to go to Europe that next winter, if I remember."</p>
<p>"Well, she studied music at home, didn't she? The best that money</p>
<p>could buy was hers."</p>
<p>"What is this seems to be on her mind about Beethoven or Mozart or</p>
<p>one of them? She cried to me a little up there just now about</p>
<p>Beethoven."</p>
<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. There was some discussion a few days before</p>
<p>Olga sailed about that print of Beethoven that used to hang in the</p>
<p>dining room. That must in some way be fuddled in the poor child's</p>
<p>brain. Olga wanted it down. It seems silly now, but during the war</p>
<p>in some devilish way, it sounded rational enough, and there was an</p>
<p>argument. Olga felt rather firmly about it. Finally Bertha carted</p>
<p>it up to the storeroom. That's all there was to it. Up to that time</p>
<p>Paula had been working on the Sonata Appassionata. It seemed to</p>
<p>upset her. Bertha, get down that print of Beethoven that you carried</p>
<p>up to the storeroom that day and hang it back in the dining room."</p>
<p>"I--please excuse--I hung it back there yesterday."</p>
<p>"Presumptuous! The kind of thing I very much dislike. It merely</p>
<p>happened to be all right in this case. Don't let it happen again.</p>
<p>Bring Dr. Ehrenfest some fresh muffins."</p>
<p>"There's a strange woman."</p>
<p>"A priceless servant and yet sometimes--so strange--so</p>
<p>strange--that--that----"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I--don't--know----"</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>You stood in the pantry and shivered and put your hands up over your</p>
<p>ears. Your teeth were on edge and the entire surface of your body</p>
<p>hurt.</p>
<p>They were taking Paula. Dr. Ehrenfest and Dr. Lauer, and a nurse in</p>
<p>a cap like a charlotte russe case. Little Paula, whose bones were</p>
<p>squab-like and who was the faint color of ashes of roses. Her</p>
<p>strength terrified you. She did not want to go and you knew as you</p>
<p>stood hurting all over the surface of you, that she was biting and</p>
<p>kicking. Then you stole out to help, but you were trembling so and</p>
<p>somehow you did not want Paula to know that you knew.</p>
<p>The strength of Paula. She would not be carried. And so she sat and</p>
<p>crouched, with her terrified hands flaming white at the knuckles and</p>
<p>twisted around the rungs of the banisters, and her eyes the lovely</p>
<p>troubled Ophelia eyes. The blazing, blazing, flame-blue disks.</p>
<p>You cried with your heart. It was not to be borne. The carrying of</p>
<p>Paula kicking and screaming down those flights. The streamers of her</p>
<p>sobs. The streamers....</p>
<p>"Paula," cried Bertha and ran up the steps toward her cowering at the</p>
<p>banisters there.</p>
<p>"Bertha, Bertha," sobbed Paula, and uncurled her fingers, "they're</p>
<p>taking me down off the wall. They're taking me up to the</p>
<p>storeroom----"</p>
<p>"No, no, Miss Paula, they're taking you to make you well."</p>
<p>"You knew, Bertha. You used to sit on the steps and listen. They</p>
<p>took him away from us, Bertha--you remember--I cried. Olga--the</p>
<p>feeding of the men. The mad little men who hated Beethoven. They</p>
<p>took him away from us, Bertha----"</p>
<p>"No, no, Miss Paula, he's downstairs in the dining room where he used</p>
<p>to be."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Come, Miss Paula, with Bertha."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"To a house in the country where you are going to get well."</p>
<p>"They took--him away--from us. You used to peel the potatoes. I</p>
<p>could hear them fall in the pan. You listened----"</p>
<p>"Come, Miss Paula."</p>
<p>She went down the stairs and out of the house like a child then.</p>
<p>"Good-by, Bertha--they took him away from us--but I knew--you</p>
<p>knew----"</p>
<p>"Good-by, Miss Paula."</p>
<p>She sat up as stiffly in the car as a doll, with blue Ophelia eyes,</p>
<p>and let them seat themselves in a sort of dreadful battalion around</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>"We knew--we knew----" she said to Bertha, who was left standing on</p>
<p>the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Upstairs in her bedroom Mrs. Oessetrich sat rocking herself. Rocking</p>
<p>herself in a straight chair.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The house was like a tomb. It stood all day, listening. Upstairs,</p>
<p>downstairs, and the old pulling pains at the backs of Bertha's legs.</p>
<p>It was difficult without a second girl. They came and to the trip</p>
<p>hammer of Mrs. Oessetrich's tongue they left. Insolently, most of</p>
<p>them, and usually in the midst of a half-swept room or with windows</p>
<p>flung high and the curtains pinned away for thorough cleaning. It</p>
<p>was not much better with the day-help. They never came back the</p>
<p>second time.</p>
<p>But after the Armistice, the agencies began to feed them out again.</p>
<p>Sullen men who did outdoor work and washed windows in their old army</p>
<p>coats.</p>
<p>"Two dollars and sixty cents a day! What's the world coming to?</p>
<p>Don't have that dirty-looking fellow in the old tan coat come here</p>
<p>any more. I dislike his manner. There is something so bolsheviki</p>
<p>about him."</p>
<p>The old tan coat was a doughboy's, grimy beyond recognition. He was</p>
<p>one of the scissors men and had been stoked up on sandwiches from</p>
<p>hands as fair as Olga's. The bolsheviki look was the two dollars and</p>
<p>sixty cents a day recompense for a badly gassed lung.</p>
<p>Laundry work had gone up, too. "It is ruinous. Three dollars and</p>
<p>ten cents. Why, a family could live on that in the old days."</p>
<p>But not in the new. The new purged days since the war.</p>
<p>"Give her my Venetian point tablecloth to launder, Bertha. Tell her</p>
<p>to be sure and use tepid water and a warm iron. It cost two hundred</p>
<p>and fifty dollars before the war. It has to be done scallop by</p>
<p>scallop."</p>
<p>Three dollars and ten cents a day to iron Mrs. Oessetrich's two</p>
<p>hundred and fifty dollar Venetian point tablecloth. Scallop by</p>
<p>scallop. Somehow if you looked at it that way--three dollars and ten</p>
<p>cents for the eight hours of standing on the granatoid floor of the</p>
<p>laundry was not so very high. Scallop by scallop....</p>
<p>Bertha's wages had been raised to fifty dollars. The bulge in her</p>
<p>petticoat pocket was growing again. Helga's funeral had depleted it</p>
<p>for a while. Helga, who loved to be snug and warm, would have hated</p>
<p>to lie in an untufted casket.</p>
<p>But with the raise to fifty dollars, the little hit-hit began again.</p>
<p>It followed her all around the house. The stilly house. The</p>
<p>listening house. The waiting, brooding, silenced house.</p>
<p>You looked forward to Monday nights because of the recreation of all</p>
<p>the crystal chandeliers set blazing then and out came the solid gold</p>
<p>plate that was kept wadded in cotton in the safe in Mrs. Oessetrich's</p>
<p>boudoir.</p>
<p>Monday night was opera night. The Oessetrichs had subscribed for the</p>
<p>same first tier box for fifteen years. The Oessetrich little girls</p>
<p>had grown up to those seats, so to speak, until gradually their feet</p>
<p>had reached the floor and their heads shot up over the backs. Paula</p>
<p>had kept the programs. They were in a stack up in the room. The</p>
<p>lower ones all yellow.</p>
<p>Usually now the von Schlegels and Madam Gerbhardt or Godfather and</p>
<p>Aunt Mary Oessetrich came to dine on Monday nights and then went on</p>
<p>to the opera.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oessetrich in her shining expanse of hard colored satin. The</p>
<p>beautiful diamond necklace, mounted very clumsily on red gold. The</p>
<p>bugle and passementerie and crystal trimmings. The heavy</p>
<p>incrustations of bead embroidery. She glittered and she clinked.</p>
<p>You wanted to ring her as you would a bell.</p>
<p>Small but complicated dinners with a helper in the kitchen and Bertha</p>
<p>in her role of waitress, boxed into a black sateen uniform that</p>
<p>spanned her between the shoulders, and the white organdie turnover</p>
<p>collar that seemed to jut out her cheek bones and give the wide area</p>
<p>between that startling clarity of a nun's.</p>
<p>One evening there was to be a new opera. Madam Gerbhardt had the</p>
<p>score. She sang snatches of it at dinner, and before the wraps were</p>
<p>brought, she sat down at the concert grand piano in the drawing-room</p>
<p>and played off pages of it. Coq D'Or. Tickling golden nonsense.</p>
<p>Oh, but you wanted to strut and stick yourself out in front like a</p>
<p>fat king and hold off the gold platter with the excavated mound of</p>
<p>pistachio pudding and rollic with it as if you had stepped down off a</p>
<p>playing card. Fat, mad king.</p>
<p>Coq D'Or. You wanted Madam Gerbhardt to sit there in her</p>
<p>upholstered-looking blue velvet with the cut steel buttons down it,</p>
<p>and play them all out over the piano. All the lively little Coq D'Or</p>
<p>people who resided in the foolish heart of the opera. The kings and</p>
<p>queens and the jacks and the jokers off the playing cards. The</p>
<p>little streets down which they swarmed over cobblestones and the</p>
<p>houses with waving crooked sides like the bend of a concertina.</p>
<p>Crazy houses with a jester's cap on the peak, and a bell hanging down</p>
<p>over one window. You could see them as you strutted out with the</p>
<p>pistachio pudding. Purple sky like a bruise. And all the ladies had</p>
<p>long thin necks with hooks in them, like swans'. They were the</p>
<p>queens of the playing cards. And all the kings had little bellies</p>
<p>and strutted. Coq D'Or. It made you merry and it made you foolish</p>
<p>and it made you see the new-fangled bewilderment of a sky the color</p>
<p>of a bruise. Hoodlum music that ran the wrong way off the keys, like</p>
<p>the Chinaman in the subway who read up and down off his newspaper.</p>
<p>Tra-la-la-la-la--lalala. Lawk, you had almost stumbled with the</p>
<p>solid gold platter of the pistachio.</p>
<p>"Bertha, bring the wraps."</p>
<p>Yah--yah--the silly queen.</p>
<p>"Bertha, see if the car is at the door."</p>
<p>Yah--yah--the silly queen with the hook in her neck like the plumbing</p>
<p>underneath the stationary washstand. Coq D'Or--pouring golden</p>
<p>nonsense....</p>
<p>And the talk. You learned if you listened as you passed around the</p>
<p>platters, charmed glittering names. Marguerite. Ophelia. La</p>
<p>Navarraise. Sappho. Santuzza. Thais. Heifetz. Tosca. Caruso.</p>
<p>Sembrich. Friedheim. Pederewski. von Buelow. Hoffman. Elman.</p>
<p>Wieniawski. Ysaye. Charvet. Charvet.</p>
<p>One evening at dinner Madam Gerbhardt said something about this</p>
<p>charmed and glittering name, that hung in the memory like a Christmas</p>
<p>tree ball.</p>
<p>"Charvet is only a boy. They say, by the way, he is American.</p>
<p>Without a doubt he is one of the foremost pianist composers of the</p>
<p>day. Have you heard him this season, 'Tilda?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"The moon-haunted fashion in which he played at yesterday's concert!</p>
<p>He must have the heart of a woman, the brain of a poet, and the valor</p>
<p>of a man. Ah, Charvet--there is a new master for you. Charvet."</p>
<p>"Ah, Charvet"--you tiptoed out with the platters. "Ah, Charvet." To</p>
<p>be moon-haunted was to live with an opal mist about one's heart.</p>
<p>Bertha knew....</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Go. Go. Go. Mrs. Oessetrich started out early as usual, but in the</p>
<p>excellent quality, badly fitting tweed now instead of the khaki, and</p>
<p>in the place of the fawn-colored ambulance, Eddie was out at the curb</p>
<p>again, usually with the small sedan.</p>
<p>Difficult as it was to keep the tall house from swooning into its</p>
<p>silence, somehow she partially accomplished it with the bang-bangings</p>
<p>of her comings and goings. The telephone. The telephone.</p>
<p>"_Bertha, if Madam Gerbhardt calls, tell her I will be glad to use</p>
<p>those tickets for the Vatican Choir at Carnegie Hall to-night. Tell</p>
<p>the carpenter when he comes, to meet me at Miss Olga's studio, I want</p>
<p>him to build those flower boxes before she gets back. It's beginning</p>
<p>to rain. Have those three trunks in the storeroom, with red stars on</p>
<p>them, dragged out into the hallway by the time I get home and I'll</p>
<p>spend this wet afternoon unpacking some things for Miss Paula. Dr.</p>
<p>Ehrenfest call up? Any mail? Nothing from Hill's End? Paris? Miss</p>
<p>Ermangarde? Look at the postmarks. No cables--Paris--Miss</p>
<p>Ermangarde?--sure? Oh--well----_"</p>
<p>There never were.</p>
<p>"_Well, I'll be home by two. If the awning man comes tell him to</p>
<p>wait._"</p>
<p>Hammer. Hammer. Hammer. Mrs. Oessetrich fighting the house's</p>
<p>silence. Awnings went up as early as April. Gay orange ones with</p>
<p>blue scallops. The old-fashioned little dressing room adjoining</p>
<p>Ermangarde's bedroom, with the built-in wardrobe and the stationary</p>
<p>washstand, was torn out and a shining rink of a bathroom installed.</p>
<p>Hammer. Hammer. The rippling, striped awnings and then one day the</p>
<p>entire house front lit up with new window shades. Festooned silk</p>
<p>ones that shirred up with the soft rush of a laugh. The piano in</p>
<p>Paula's room had been tuned and stood open. Smiling. Waiting. But</p>
<p>Paula never came. The door always stood open, too. But you never</p>
<p>looked in. Somehow the smile of that piano could seem more like a</p>
<p>grin.</p>
<p>Then this happened.</p>
<p>Those three trunks with the red stars on had been dragged into the</p>
<p>hallway that faced Paula's room, before it turned off into the ell</p>
<p>that led to Bertha's door.</p>
<p>All afternoon, while a slanting rain flew at the roof, Mrs.</p>
<p>Oessetrich puttered up there among Paula's things. Bertha, waxing</p>
<p>the newly installed hardwood floor in Paula's room could glance out</p>
<p>into the hallway and see her stooped there with her dry shattered</p>
<p>eyes roving among the dry things. Paula's little things. Paula</p>
<p>loved little things. There was a whole trayful of the kind of</p>
<p>trinkets that amused her. Jade elephants. Nubs of chrysoprose and</p>
<p>malachite. Carved intaglios. Cat's eye trifles and chalcedony.</p>
<p>Rock-crystal hens. A silver filigree shrine the size of a thimble</p>
<p>and wrought with amazing detail. There was a Christus with the ewe</p>
<p>lamb, hand carved out of the yellow eye of a topaz. Green jasper</p>
<p>amulet. A little girl's pocket-book, red lined and fashioned out of</p>
<p>two shells with Niagara Falls written across it. Shoes. The soles a</p>
<p>little thinned in the delicate way that Paula would wear them down.</p>
<p>Letters. A tray of them sorted in stacks. The curious rain-tapped</p>
<p>silence and Mathilde Oessetrich with her eyes that still had the look</p>
<p>of the cracked shoe buttons.</p>
<p>Paula's tray of letters. There was something so faint and pale about</p>
<p>them. They seemed to rise up in the vapor of a sigh.</p>
<p>After the waxing of the floor there were potatoes to peel and the</p>
<p>great red eye of a roast for dinner required larding to make the</p>
<p>juices run.</p>
<p>You picked your way down the back stairs, carefully, to save the</p>
<p>squeaks.</p>
<p>The afternoon drew in the silence like a poultice.</p>
<p>The red roast when you larded it with the stripes of suet swelled up</p>
<p>around your finger clammily, and with the heart gone from the meat,</p>
<p>out came your finger from the hole with a sucky little pop. The</p>
<p>house felt like that. It flowed around you so coldly, with the heart</p>
<p>gone out of it, and the pop of the rain drops--pop--pop----</p>
<p>Finally Mrs. Oessetrich came down into the kitchen. Her skin was all</p>
<p>dry, like a fowl's, and it was beginning to wattle at the neck. She</p>
<p>was much thinner. It made everything about her lower. Her waistline</p>
<p>and the sags underneath her eyes.</p>
<p>"Bertha." she said, and sat down on the edge of a chair, "has anyone</p>
<p>had access to the storeroom besides you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You have always followed my instructions and permitted none of the</p>
<p>day help in there?"</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"Sure? Think carefully."</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"Well, something has happened. Bear in mind that these questions I</p>
<p>am about to ask are disagreeable ones, but they must be asked."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Bertha, there has been a systematic rifling of things going on in</p>
<p>the storeroom. Trunks have been pried open. Articles are missing.</p>
<p>There is a leak in my household."</p>
<p>"A--what----"</p>
<p>"A thief."</p>
<p>"You mean----"</p>
<p>"I mean that articles of Miss Paula's that I have been putting away</p>
<p>from time to time in trunks, during the period that she has not</p>
<p>been--so--well--have been stolen. Two of the trunks have been pried</p>
<p>open with hairpins and articles of more or less value are missing."</p>
<p>"You mean----"</p>
<p>"I mean nothing until I have gone further into this matter. You are</p>
<p>still a trusted servant. Now come upstairs with me."</p>
<p>The sickening process of that. Bertha, to whom things were so</p>
<p>trivial, suddenly quivering before their omnipotence.</p>
<p>Paula's trunk had been looted. All the neat little stacks of her</p>
<p>lovely handiwork were in swirls of confusion on the trays. A</p>
<p>pasteboard box had been gouged at one end and its contents dragged</p>
<p>out. A hairpin had got itself twisted about the lock and a hurried</p>
<p>hand had left it there.</p>
<p>"You can see for yourself, Bertha, someone from the inside has been</p>
<p>at work. Can you think of any explanation for these rifled trunks?"</p>
<p>"I--no----"</p>
<p>"This amounts to more than petty thievery. There were beautiful silk</p>
<p>garments here. Some of them imported and some of them beautifully</p>
<p>made by Miss Paula herself of the sheerest materials."</p>
<p>"Yah ..."</p>
<p>"I was going to take some of them to her at the san--hospital, She</p>
<p>will be shocked when she comes home and learns what has happened.</p>
<p>Her things. Paula loved things. Why, there were three white crepe</p>
<p>gowns on this tray that I remember distinctly packing away.</p>
<p>Beauties, with yards and yards of real Valenciennes that her</p>
<p>godmother had especially made for her in Valenciennes."</p>
<p>"White _crêpe de chine_--real Valenciennes."</p>
<p>"Just see! Oh. Oh. This box torn open and a rose quartz brooch</p>
<p>that was very precious to her--Harrison's--a gift to her from a dear</p>
<p>friend--stolen. Who has dared?"</p>
<p>You just stood and felt your nails dig up into your palms, and your</p>
<p>lips were so heavy. You kept trying to move them, but they would not</p>
<p>lift.</p>
<p>"I intend to get to the bottom of this--regardless."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Oessetrich----"</p>
<p>"Why Bertha, you are crimson! Bertha?"</p>
<p>"I--you see--yoost remembered---yoost thought----"</p>
<p>"Just thought what?"</p>
<p>"Answer me."</p>
<p>"I--don't--know----"</p>
<p>"Bertha!"</p>
<p>"It isn't possible. Not you. The most trusted servant I ever had!"</p>
<p>"But Mrs. Oessetrich, I----"</p>
<p>"So this is the mystery of you."</p>
<p>"I----"</p>
<p>"You strange white creature, you. This is the meaning----"</p>
<p>"I didn't know--"</p>
<p>"You thief! I never in my wildest dreams would have suspected you.</p>
<p>Who knows what systematic process of stealing has been going on all</p>
<p>these years under my very eyes."</p>
<p>"No--no--no!"</p>
<p>"Paula. My daughter Paula who trusted you. Who loved you."</p>
<p>"Please----"</p>
<p>"Thief! I shall call in detectives."</p>
<p>"No--no--please--I didn't know----"</p>
<p>"I too trusted you. I respected you. Oh, I cannot believe my</p>
<p>senses."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Oessetrich, I only----"</p>
<p>"What nonsense has been talked in this household about you. Miss</p>
<p>Olga who always insisted that you had the soul of a poet trapped in</p>
<p>the body of a peasant. The soul of a thief!"</p>
<p>Dumb Bertha standing there with her lips all shirred in like an old</p>
<p>woman's and her eyes down. It was horrible keeping her eyes down.</p>
<p>It made her face a bonfire around them.</p>
<p>"Come upstairs into your room with me. I intend to go to the bottom</p>
<p>of this."</p>
<p>The ignominy of that. Standing there with her arms huddled up and</p>
<p>her eyes seeming to suck back into her head like raisins into dough.</p>
<p>The opening and closing of drawers. Each dragging time the wood</p>
<p>seemed to run against the grain of her flesh and leave her shivering</p>
<p>there with a sense of splinters plunging horridly into her. Jagged</p>
<p>little needles.</p>
<p>Open. Shut. Open. Shut.</p>
<p>"What's that, in there?"</p>
<p>"Yoost my aprons."</p>
<p>"And that heavy thick stuff?"</p>
<p>"Yoost my nightgowns."</p>
<p>"Umph. You were clever enough to dispose of what you took, I see.</p>
<p>Why come to think of it, I've seen you carting packages out of the</p>
<p>house. I remember stopping you in the passageway one day. You were</p>
<p>furtive then. I realize it now. What's this?"</p>
<p>"Yoost music, Mrs. Oessetrich. Please--don't touch. Yoost some old</p>
<p>sheets of music I had before I came here."</p>
<p>"Humph. Loot from somewhere else, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Oh--oh----"</p>
<p>"Ugh, what a task! To think that I should ever have to resort to</p>
<p>such degrading methods with you. Well, I see that you are clever</p>
<p>enough to keep your clothes closet bare as a bone. Let's see, now.</p>
<p>Oh, get up on that chair and open up those two cupboard doors above</p>
<p>the closet. I intend to go to the bottom of this."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Oessetrich--those little doors I have never once opened since I</p>
<p>am here."</p>
<p>"Hand me that chair. I don't believe in half-way methods."</p>
<p>Your lips, they were so heavy they would not lift.</p>
<p>To reach the pair of small doors Mrs. Oessetrich had to strain tiptoe</p>
<p>on the chair.</p>
<p>"Please Mrs. Oessetrich, if you would just let me say----"</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh. Oh."</p>
<p>The little chills ran off you like sand down a dune. Cold</p>
<p>goosefleshing chills. The small cupboard doors jerked open with a</p>
<p>spill of things. To stand indicted before the stern irrefutable law</p>
<p>of ownership. The indubitable right of Mrs. Oessetrich to her</p>
<p>things. The colossal rights of ownership. Those rights had been</p>
<p>outraged. It brought out in Mrs. Oessetrich's face the lean look of</p>
<p>wolf.</p>
<p>The webby lovelinesses of Paula's. Chiffon with its pollen-like</p>
<p>power to cling to a woman's flesh. Articles that had been jammed up</p>
<p>there quickly. To stand there and gaze was to turn the eyes into</p>
<p>blisters. The cream lace boudoir cap of Mrs. Oessetrich's, for which</p>
<p>there had been a topsy-turvy search one Saturday morning, tucked up</p>
<p>there behind one of Paula's little fluted silk negligees. The blue</p>
<p>fox scarf that Ermangarde had been finally forced to decide she had</p>
<p>left in a taxicab. A gold and vermilion batik scarf of Olga's.</p>
<p>Stacks of unworn white gloves, Paula's narrow size. More of the</p>
<p>filmy things. Peach-colored gowns with the rills of Valenciennes.</p>
<p>Things. The scalding wrath of Mrs. Oessetrich over her silk</p>
<p>rag-a-tags. Her inalienable right to them.</p>
<p>To stand branded with the puniness of desire for them. To stand</p>
<p>there blanched to the very color of her teeth before Mrs. Oessetrich,</p>
<p>whose face had begun to narrow until the nose sharpened like the</p>
<p>blade of a knife. The shame ... you could scarcely breathe....</p>
<p>"So! These fur-lined bedroom slippers of mine that I haven't even</p>
<p>missed. Silk stockings. Bath salts. Sachet. You stupid,</p>
<p>luxury-loving girl. You of all people! A great coarse peasant girl</p>
<p>who seemed utterly impervious to creature things. But you have not</p>
<p>taken all this for the sake of the things themselves. You have</p>
<p>carted it out of the house. You are in league with someone. With</p>
<p>whom?"</p>
<p>"No. No."</p>
<p>"Miss Ermangarde's French batiste blouse! More sachet! My silver</p>
<p>shoe buckles. Why--why this is a case for the police."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Oessetrich, you would not----"</p>
<p>"Up here alone is stored several hundred dollars' worth of my</p>
<p>possessions. What quantities you must have carted away without my</p>
<p>knowing it. Come here, you. Stand there and look me in the eye.</p>
<p>How long has this been going on?"</p>
<p>"I--don't--know----"</p>
<p>"You don't know. Well, I advise you to find out and be pretty quick</p>
<p>about it. Maybe the police can help you to remember. This string of</p>
<p>lapis lazuli and carnelian beads. Do you realize that it in itself</p>
<p>is worth several hundred dollars?"</p>
<p>"Dollars..."</p>
<p>"Yes, dollars and don't dare let on that you did not know the value</p>
<p>of them."</p>
<p>"Dollars. Let me pay in dollars. Mrs. Oessetrich. I'll give it</p>
<p>back in dollars."</p>
<p>It was impossible to fumble down into the petticoat pocket quickly</p>
<p>enough. The fingers were so numb and did not seem separate.</p>
<p>"See, Mrs. Oessetrich, if only you will please be so kind. Dollars.</p>
<p>More than two hundred. I will pay for the things with dollars."</p>
<p>"Stolen money, too, I suppose. Thank goodness, my vaults have been</p>
<p>safe from you."</p>
<p>"No. No. Saved money."</p>
<p>"Money cannot buy exemption from punishment for crime."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Oessetrich, here, if you will please to take it--my Liberty</p>
<p>Bond----"</p>
<p>"You must accept your punishment like anyone else. Our penal system</p>
<p>is to protect society from such as you."</p>
<p>"Take what I got."</p>
<p>"Why should I? You are a thief. I do not know why I even listen to</p>
<p>you."</p>
<p>"You do--because----"</p>
<p>"Because I am a foolish, sentimental woman, my children to the</p>
<p>contrary notwithstanding."</p>
<p>"Please----"</p>
<p>"I am a weakling for permitting you to prevail upon me. You swear to</p>
<p>me that you are in league with no one."</p>
<p>"Oh, I do. I do."</p>
<p>"What was it that I saw you carrying out of the house that day I</p>
<p>stopped you----"</p>
<p>"----for Helga--at the hospital----"</p>
<p>"I don't seem able to deal with you as you deserve. There is</p>
<p>something about you--what is it?"</p>
<p>"Let me pay, Mrs. Oessetrich--see--money, and my bond."</p>
<p>"Put what you have down there on the table."</p>
<p>"Here it is."</p>
<p>"I shall take it and give it to the Red Cross: It is your</p>
<p>restitution. You should be made to pay a harder one. Now you leave</p>
<p>my house. Get out your valise or whatever you call the bag that you</p>
<p>brought your things in. Open it and let me see what is in it. More</p>
<p>loot, no doubt."</p>
<p>"No, Mrs. Oessetrich, there is nothing but----"</p>
<p>"Open it, I said."</p>
<p>"There."</p>
<p>"What is that green chiffon? Where did you get that old-fashioned</p>
<p>thing?"</p>
<p>"It's mine! Someone gave it to me."</p>
<p>"Ugh, fuzzy old evening wrap. Well, you didn't get that here. Now</p>
<p>pack your things. What is this? A book. _The Cathedral Under_----"</p>
<p>"No. No. Don't touch that book. It is mine."</p>
<p>"What are you doing with that volume of Rollo Farley in your bag?</p>
<p>You must have stolen that from Miss Ermangarde's desk. Why that book</p>
<p>is almost her bible. How dared you!"</p>
<p>"No! No! No! I tell you, no! Mine! Don't you! That book, Mrs.</p>
<p>Oessetrich--is mine."</p>
<p>"I am convinced now that you are vicious. Don't you dare hold my arm</p>
<p>that way. Put down that book or I shall telephone this minute for</p>
<p>the police."</p>
<p>"Put it down! How dare you ransack even our books. Give me that</p>
<p>book. You are not fit to touch it. You! _The Cathedral Under the</p>
<p>Sea_!"</p>
<p>"You don't know----"</p>
<p>"I know that if you do not put it down immediately I shall call the</p>
<p>police."</p>
<p>"Please----"</p>
<p>"Immediately, or I'll----"</p>
<p>"There."</p>
<p>"Now pack your things. I'll be waiting for you down in the kitchen.</p>
<p>You cannot leave this house without I take a final look into your</p>
<p>belongings. I am actually ill from this outrageous scene. Now pack.</p>
<p>Remember, just that pile of thick ugly things on the table there.</p>
<p>I'll be waiting ... come down the rear stairs...."</p>
<p>It was hard with all her fingers swollen thumbs, to cram the things</p>
<p>into the bag and the chills seemed to run down off her spine just</p>
<p>like sand. The stiff, unwieldy sailor's union suits. When they were</p>
<p>folded over once, they rose up solemnly in the bottom of the bag and</p>
<p>had to be weighted down with shoes. The striped, clean-smelling</p>
<p>flannel petticoat. The cake of hard brown soap. The bit of</p>
<p>Bulgarian embroidery. The green of Mrs. Farley's evening wrap. It</p>
<p>crowded over the top. Ocean green. To close your eyes a moment and</p>
<p>feel that spread of ocean green. The tears ran down and suddenly</p>
<p>they too were ocean. Things. Things. Things. Mrs. Oessetrich's</p>
<p>things. Helga's. Olga's. Ermangarde's. The green thought of ocean</p>
<p>flowed over and wiped them out and left the old stark uncluttered</p>
<p>silence. And to sit in that silence the second before you pinned on</p>
<p>your disk of a hat was to gather back strength.</p>
<p>The silence that still seemed full of the mewlings of Mrs. Oessetrich</p>
<p>over the things. Things. Helga who had loved them and had never</p>
<p>felt the green thought of ocean flow over and obliterate them.</p>
<p>The book was not a thing. It was a dear hurt heart lying forbidden</p>
<p>there on the table. It throbbed, when you held it up against your</p>
<p>cheek. It grew warm with the tears, the hot searing tears of</p>
<p>degradation that flowed out finally into that calm wide sense of</p>
<p>ocean.</p>
<p>"Bertha--you--up there, why are you so long? Hurry down here the</p>
<p>rear way and see to it that you pack only what strictly belongs to</p>
<p>you."</p>
<p>The book belonged. It belonged as warmly and as closely as</p>
<p>heartbeat. To leave it lying there on that table would be to leave a</p>
<p>heart. Then Bertha grew sly. So sly that the carpetbag closed</p>
<p>without even a click of a hasp over the volume of _The Cathedral</p>
<p>Under the Sea_.</p>
<p>To tiptoe down the front flight of stairs, the bag in one hand,</p>
<p>carefully away from the banisters, and her little purse of loose</p>
<p>change in the other, was like walking on cushions. The carpet rose</p>
<p>so roundly to the step. There was not so much as a creak and even</p>
<p>though the dreadful chills were running off her spine again, just the</p>
<p>lifting of the front door by the handle as it swung in, saved the</p>
<p>little squeal of its hinges and with Mrs. Oessetrich's voice rising</p>
<p>again from the rear of the house, the door closed again, noiselessly,</p>
<p>with Bertha on its outer side.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Annie was gone. It was a shock to come upon the house standing</p>
<p>eyeless there, with iron shutters across the windows and the front</p>
<p>stoop removed. A produce company used it for a warehouse. A crane</p>
<p>jutted out of one of the second story windows that had been converted</p>
<p>into a sliding door.</p>
<p>Change. The city swirling and sucking in the days had sucked in</p>
<p>Annie and the lodging house with the sour halls. It felt strange</p>
<p>coming down to face the warehouse with the crane hanging out. It had</p>
<p>some hay clinging to it as if it had not quite licked its chops.</p>
<p>There had stood Annie's lodging house, lean as a witch.</p>
<p>Quicksands. You could imagine the building, story by story</p>
<p>disappearing to the subtle suction, until only the dirty roof</p>
<p>remained and Jocko with a stiff, terrorized tail. And Annie. She</p>
<p>would have gone down last with her hands waving and protesting. They</p>
<p>would be the very last above the sands, Annie's hands, with the</p>
<p>fingers that were the shape of potatoes. Annie's strangling</p>
<p>hands--even Annie--love of life....</p>
<p>Front Street banged along. Down toward Bowling Green the produce</p>
<p>firms stood banked up in front with the boxed vegetables and fruits.</p>
<p>Frozen smells with the green coming softly through the mild February</p>
<p>day. Bang. Bang. Trucks over cobblestones. One of them stood</p>
<p>backed to the curb while a negro with a red cave for a mouth flung</p>
<p>crates of fruit, the yellow light of the oranges showing through,</p>
<p>across the sidewalk to another negro who caught them on the fly.</p>
<p>Bang. Bang. Trucks over cobblestones. Sh-h-h. Sh-h-h. Trucks</p>
<p>over quicksands.</p>
<p>At Bowling Green the fan of the sea came in. The carpetbag, even</p>
<p>though she shifted hands as she lugged it, began to cut. There was a</p>
<p>bench close to the railing.</p>
<p>When you sat down and leaned over, you stared right down into the</p>
<p>face of the harbor. To sit down there with a sigh, your back to the</p>
<p>city and your eyes to the sea, rested you and made that terrifying</p>
<p>day seem to recede.</p>
<p>The silly, terrifying day of the carnelian beads.</p>
<p>The puny little day on the edge of the ocean. Presently it would</p>
<p>pass out with the tide. As Annie's day had passed out, the day of</p>
<p>the carnelian beads and the cream lace boudoir cap would roll into</p>
<p>that immensity out there clothed in fog. The beauty, through the</p>
<p>fog, of that immensity!</p>
<p>She kept dreaming into it. Even that night when she finally found a</p>
<p>bed, up three flights in a cubby-hole of a filthy tenement on</p>
<p>Desbrosses Street, she kept dreaming into it. That pyramid of</p>
<p>immensity out there that was built out of days.</p>
<p>A certain phrase began to run along the weeks.</p>
<p>She's too old. She's too old. She's too old.</p>
<p>At first it gripped her breath and made her heart shy back in a hot</p>
<p>sort of flush. She's too old. She could read the phrase on the lips</p>
<p>of clients as they discussed her at the desk with the Bohemian who</p>
<p>conducted the employment office. Sometimes when she applied at homes</p>
<p>with the slip from the agency, they told her point blank.</p>
<p>"No. No. We don't want a middle-aged woman. Tell them at the</p>
<p>agency to send us a young girl. You're too old."</p>
<p>"But----"</p>
<p>"I know. You look like a strong, honest woman, but you're too old."</p>
<p>After a while the phrase began to rock. To have a cadence. It even</p>
<p>lulled. It made it suddenly easy to sit in the back row of the</p>
<p>office and wait until the younger girls were accounted for. It was</p>
<p>like sitting out of the crowd in a shady spot and watching the</p>
<p>troubled barterers in a market place. They hurried so and cared so</p>
<p>and their eyes were all crowded with self. While you sat back</p>
<p>against the wall and waited, you could imagine those faces all in</p>
<p>one. The faces of the barterers. The faces of those who could be</p>
<p>eager over the carnelian beads. A long, lean, composite face, with a</p>
<p>nose like a scimitar and the eyes that were full of self, so close</p>
<p>together that they almost seemed one.</p>
<p>You sat in the back row along with the charwomen, because you were</p>
<p>old with your hair and your skin and your bones and the zest in your</p>
<p>arms.</p>
<p>Clients with the eyes full of self that were so close together that</p>
<p>they almost seemed one, did not know that to be young with your heart</p>
<p>was to be a garden surrounded by the high gray walls of the flesh.</p>
<p>They saw only the high gray wall of the flesh, the tired shoulders,</p>
<p>and the white wing in the hair.</p>
<p>There was no evading it. Bertha was getting older with her skin and</p>
<p>her hair and the zest in her arms. Day work tired her terribly,</p>
<p>because it was mostly scrubbing. Sometimes when she returned to the</p>
<p>cubby-hole in Desbrosses Street the entire surface of her body gave</p>
<p>off a singing sensation.</p>
<p>It was a mean room without a place to wash, but there was a public</p>
<p>sink in the hallway of each of the tenement floors. Sometimes Bertha</p>
<p>did a furtive thing. The tin basin in her room was so small. You</p>
<p>could only slap the face with water. Often when the halls were quiet</p>
<p>of the squalling of children and the black skull of a house seemed to</p>
<p>sleep, Bertha, in her bare feet, stole out softly to the sink and</p>
<p>slipped down her chemise.</p>
<p>If she bent down double under the faucet the cool water poured over</p>
<p>her back. She could feel the smoothness of her flesh with the</p>
<p>evenness of the flow. At first it sent a delicious shudder through</p>
<p>her right up into her throat, and then it flowed so clean and so pure</p>
<p>and so cool. It was like being as still as a mountain with a rill</p>
<p>running down it. The water slid off her white back and around up</p>
<p>under the warmth of her breasts. It dripped down into the sink with</p>
<p>green little forest noises. They helped the ache, these furtive</p>
<p>rinses, and sometimes when her feet were great swollen pads, she let</p>
<p>the water pour over them too. It was easier then not to lie awake of</p>
<p>tiredness.</p>
<p>The fact was to be faced that even day work was no longer easily</p>
<p>obtainable. Sometimes the janitors and the superintendents of</p>
<p>buildings passed her by for the next. "She's too old."</p>
<p>Without the little hitting friendliness of her savings in her</p>
<p>petticoat pocket, that was a little terrifying. The room in</p>
<p>Desbrosses Street was a dollar a week and there were strict fire laws</p>
<p>against cooking in the rickety old building over gas jets or alcohol</p>
<p>lamps. The quick lunch rooms, even the meanest of them, made heavy</p>
<p>inroads on the day's pay. At best they were dreadful, fume-fogged</p>
<p>places, where the fried foods clung to the cold plates on rims of</p>
<p>grease and the coffee was the color and consistency of clay-bank.</p>
<p>Often it seemed to Bertha that it simply would not go down. The warm</p>
<p>slush of it in her mouth. To close the eyes and gulp until the tears</p>
<p>sprang, accomplished it. It was easier to bear than the knife-pangs</p>
<p>of hunger which could come slashing down on Bertha. They cut her in</p>
<p>two. Bertha dreaded hunger. It made her shamble when she walked.</p>
<p>It lifted the top off her head. It cut.</p>
<p>Sometimes, that rather terrifying year, even though you were the</p>
<p>first to report at the agency, there was only work three days in the</p>
<p>week. To be a little hungry was not so bad if you stayed in the room</p>
<p>on your cot. That was what Bertha did on the idle days. Stretched</p>
<p>out there, the hunger gnawed up and down her great body like a rat</p>
<p>and would not let her sleep. But it was easier lying there. The top</p>
<p>stayed on your head.</p>
<p>There was the peasant of her for you. Strong hot foods. Meats.</p>
<p>Sour rye bread with a tight and heavy mesh. Pea soup so thick that</p>
<p>it poured from the pot in clumps. Without them the pull died in her</p>
<p>legs and the lunge from her arm sockets. The concocted foods of the</p>
<p>lunch room, the gray-looking stews, and custards with the ooze of</p>
<p>water on top were pallid on her tongue.</p>
<p>All that winter, while on three days' earnings she must live for</p>
<p>seven, and the reefer jacket grew horrible of the patches that the</p>
<p>fabric could no longer hold, the blades kept slashing. The hunger</p>
<p>blades.</p>
<p>Sometimes in washing down a corridor the floor began to wave, or</p>
<p>walking home or standing in the crush of a street car, you could</p>
<p>never foretell just when, that dreadful top-of-your-head feeling;</p>
<p>that lightness that would make you want to</p>
<p>sway--loose-kneed--down--down. And then that little singing</p>
<p>sensation, like a kettle boiling, that you felt against your</p>
<p>windpipe. The nervousness of that. It was not easy to feel</p>
<p>light-headed and cold and pursued by that little singing irritation</p>
<p>in your throat, and still plunge a high power arm into the pail and</p>
<p>fling out a wide and soapy fan of wet.</p>
<p>Bertha suffered that winter after a fantastic fashion. The days</p>
<p>seemed etched on glass. Thin cold flat days. Like the window pane</p>
<p>when you awoke in the morning with the wild mountain scenery frozen</p>
<p>to it. The unreality of those days. One after another after</p>
<p>another, as if you could put your fist through and crash them.</p>
<p>The idle days stretched on the cot with that incessant little</p>
<p>sensation of the boiling tea kettle along your throat. Sometimes the</p>
<p>hours became a little crazy with tilting walls and sagging ceiling.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was like lying on the under side of a wave. The</p>
<p>perversity of a bare spot on the wall where the plaster had crumbled</p>
<p>and a lath or two grinned through! Sometimes it became the amber</p>
<p>tunnels of Jocko's eyes, through which you ran along lovely</p>
<p>opalescent floors calling--calling--and all the motes in the amber</p>
<p>were faces. The faces of boys frozen into the translucence. The</p>
<p>face of the boy in the window that she had not looked upon. The</p>
<p>faces of boys. Boys. She did not glance at them as she ran calling,</p>
<p>but there was one face among the many down in the beautiful drown of</p>
<p>the amber--a dear, dear one. She did not look. She couldn't.</p>
<p>Couldn't. But the streamer of her hair with the wing of white in it,</p>
<p>drifted past his face as she ran calling--calling--Rollo--no, not</p>
<p>Rollo. Rollo was out there on the hill. Rollo was dead. That was</p>
<p>not the name. Willie had known the name of the boy. Silly Willy who</p>
<p>had felt the dig of his heels into his haunches. Felix! That was</p>
<p>the name. It snapped like a little coin purse when you said it.</p>
<p>Felix. Of course! Felix, son of Rollo.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A windfall came along. In one night she earned sixteen dollars. It</p>
<p>happened this way.</p>
<p>On a Saturday morning at the agency the front row emptied itself</p>
<p>before eleven and the younger girls, many of them on tall heels, went</p>
<p>out jauntily, a little impudently, with their slips of paper. So the</p>
<p>back row came out suddenly in its horrific sort of frieze. The</p>
<p>frieze of the scrubwomen. Old women with sucked-in faces like the</p>
<p>swirl of water down a drain hole. Women with white jade faces.</p>
<p>Women with veiny noses and cheek venules and lips that the muscles</p>
<p>would not hold into place. Women with eyes about as lifeless as</p>
<p>gelatin. Women with dead breasts.</p>
<p>Bertha stood out. Just as surely as an old horse sags to sway-back,</p>
<p>Bertha's shoulders were down, for good, but her eyes were blue with</p>
<p>water and sky. Mediterranean bays.</p>
<p>That is why, because her gaze seemed to project her in full relief</p>
<p>out from the frieze, and the front row was already emptied, Bertha</p>
<p>was selected. Delsher's had sent down for a cloakroom attendant for</p>
<p>a ball that evening.</p>
<p>"Here you! You're too old for that kinda job, but I can't give 'em</p>
<p>what I ain't got. Report there at nine to-night and ask for Gerard,</p>
<p>the steward."</p>
<p>_You're too old. You're too old. You're too old._</p>
<p>Delsher's was in Fifty-eighth Street near Fifth Avenue. An awning</p>
<p>jutted out over the sidewalk and the little striped cave was all lit</p>
<p>with electric bulbs. A puff of hot scented breath came out even at</p>
<p>the service entrance. Flesh. Warm, scented, excited flesh. That</p>
<p>odor always hung over Delsher's. From ball to ball to ball. The</p>
<p>unfastidious fact is that Delsher's smelled like a jungle. Young,</p>
<p>excited, breathing flanks.</p>
<p>There were cloakrooms on each floor. Passing along, you could see</p>
<p>the ballroom. The enchanted lake of floor, sly with wax. The jungle</p>
<p>bowed back from it with a gesture of palms with enormous fronds and</p>
<p>the crystal hanging moss of the side lights, and the tree stripes of</p>
<p>great gilt pillars. Mirrors caught at the effect and tattled it on.</p>
<p>Sometimes you could see the same tapestry and gold chair repeated six</p>
<p>stately times.</p>
<p>Bertha's allotted cloakroom was gray. The dressing tables had gold</p>
<p>pointed roofs and there were long aisles formed by the coat racks.</p>
<p>It was very simple. You exchanged a brass tag for a dazzle of</p>
<p>field-of-ermine or of cloth-of-gold.</p>
<p>The shrill, young-fleshed beauty of the old-eyed girls as they began</p>
<p>to arrive. They stepped out of the splendid surf of the wraps,</p>
<p>breastless as boys, and with wise scarlet threads for lips. The</p>
<p>insolence of them with their bobbed, flaring heads that made their</p>
<p>necks look slender and nervous. The fine fettle of young horses with</p>
<p>docked tails and pink lightening of nostrils.</p>
<p>It was bewildering. The young herd of them rushing in. The perfumed</p>
<p>dust. You saw them through the astonishing fog of cigarette smoke</p>
<p>and face powder and fur and chiffon. The brocades had a way of</p>
<p>clinging to Bertha's hands. They almost had to be ripped away from</p>
<p>the flesh. Cutting, nasty sensation. The little splitting sounds of</p>
<p>the satins along the roughened fingers. Then there were the corsets.</p>
<p>They stepped out of them. Tiny, boneless, pink satin urns. A half</p>
<p>animate feeling as you laid them away, still warm from the ripple of</p>
<p>ribs and the excited breathing.</p>
<p>The heat rose in waves and the powder began to taste in a soft</p>
<p>scented mud that lay along the tongue and back into the throat. The</p>
<p>walls had a little sway to them as the wraps mounted and mounted.</p>
<p>The brass checks. You could scarcely hand them out fast enough.</p>
<p>Slashing bareness of shoulders. Slim things with V's of nakedness</p>
<p>down to the waistline in back. More and more of the discarded, pink,</p>
<p>slim little corsets and more and more of the confluent planes of</p>
<p>torsos gliding under chiffons. That odor of jungle. The excited</p>
<p>released flanks.</p>
<p>You leaped! It was the first crash of flesh-shuddering music. The</p>
<p>naked undulating V's. A contortion ran along the cloakroom, as if</p>
<p>everyone had moved on little running muscles and yet not advanced.</p>
<p>You shivered almost, ecstatically at that. Eyelids. The white flash</p>
<p>of them lowering. Sudden slitted eyes. Insouciance of the docked</p>
<p>heads. A tree shake through the cloakroom. Only it did not begin at</p>
<p>the heart. It lay to the flesh. The shivering, shimmying flesh....</p>
<p>That gelatinous room. It nauseated. It seemed to be moving away on</p>
<p>the running muscles and yet not moving at all. It made you a little</p>
<p>sick, the motionless motion. There was nothing to clutch. The</p>
<p>insidious horridness of it. The slitted eyes. The wise red threads</p>
<p>for mouths. The ripple of torsos.</p>
<p>You sat down in the emptied cloakroom finally. You remembered the</p>
<p>lancinating pains in the ambulance. Mothers of men, was it for this?</p>
<p>You seemed to remember again--you seemed to remember--sweat and love</p>
<p>and solitary childbirth on wide moors. Swing of the grinning scythes</p>
<p>and the women who toil and who bear and who weep, and the wide-legged</p>
<p>men with the necks like tree boles. Peril of solitary childbirth on</p>
<p>wide moors. Mothers of men--was it for this....</p>
<p>The crashing and the jazzing never ceased. Where one band left off</p>
<p>another took up. Syncopated wilderness of a night. The saxophones</p>
<p>screamed into the jungle. Corsages died into the heat and cloyed it</p>
<p>up. The strange new breastless girls with the docked heads and the</p>
<p>naked V's for backs swarmed past the door with the men whose shirt</p>
<p>fronts had gone a little awry and whose irreverent eyes slid toward</p>
<p>the V of back and the willful rippling of the torsos under chiffon.</p>
<p>It was not easy to keep awake. The velvets and the furs of the wraps</p>
<p>crowded up the heat so and the tongue was all slippery with the fine</p>
<p>scented powder. That maniac, the saxophone! The smoke began to</p>
<p>sting Bertha's eyes. She commenced to doze in the miasma. They</p>
<p>started to drift in again. Some of them a little drunk. One with a</p>
<p>broken shoulder strap and the mark of teeth on the knowing little</p>
<p>knoll of her shoulder.</p>
<p>You were tempted, sewing the strap across that tender bit of flesh,</p>
<p>to spank it. The petted peacock flesh of the new generation</p>
<p>squalling its emancipation in naked backs and tipsy eyes and wriggle</p>
<p>of insinuating torso.</p>
<p>The tipsy eyes. The cloakroom began to crowd up with them. The new</p>
<p>eyes of the new youth. They were clear enough, but brilliant with</p>
<p>the hard shine of blades. The cutting, slashing blades of mowing</p>
<p>machines. The mowed-down little gardens that sometimes bloom in</p>
<p>young girls' eyes. Bold, unveiled, inquisitive eyes, these.</p>
<p>Impudent eyes, without illusion, without fear, but without the mist</p>
<p>of wonder.</p>
<p>It was strange, the young men with the awry shirt fronts who passed</p>
<p>the door, looked into the new eyes of new youth without illusion,</p>
<p>too, and without reverence and without the mist of wonder. The new</p>
<p>eyes of the new youth. New eyes but old lusts. The mowed-down</p>
<p>wastes of the garden. The star flowers that sometimes bloom in</p>
<p>women's eyes and make them madonna-like. They were mowed down by the</p>
<p>impudent steel blades. Cool, clear, matter-of-fact eyes as real as</p>
<p>Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The burning raging hours. There was no end. Crash. The gale of</p>
<p>jazz that shook the torsos. Crash. The rumble of jungle. The odor</p>
<p>of jungle.</p>
<p>There was a young man stretched out on the couch in the hallway just</p>
<p>outside the cloakroom. He was dreadful. Bla. His mouth was a mere</p>
<p>roving rhomboid in the fleshiness of his face and his eyes silly</p>
<p>pools. One of the girls held his head on her lap and played with his</p>
<p>hair. Slick clumps of polished hair. She had a startled lovely</p>
<p>face, shaped like a heart. A cigarette hung between her lips and she</p>
<p>talked through it. Once she reached into the young man's waistcoat</p>
<p>pocket and drew out a silver flask about the size and flatness of a</p>
<p>hand and tilted it to her lips. A stream oozed sidewise and down</p>
<p>along her neck. The young man lifted that four-sided mouth of his</p>
<p>and kissed the trickle.</p>
<p>You held yourself tight against the nausea of that.</p>
<p>Bertha, standing and looking at them with the deep blue channels of</p>
<p>her eyes, a silent sort of peasant tower.</p>
<p>"Who's your friend, the Woolworth Building, _Chérie_!"</p>
<p>"That's not the Woolworth Building, Jerry my only, that's Grant's</p>
<p>Tomb. Can't you tell by the dome?"</p>
<p>"I'll dance with you for that."</p>
<p>"Then make haste, Lochinvar. I'm growing awfully wobbly on my toddle</p>
<p>toddle-toddlers."</p>
<p>The wild horse of a night plunged on. The figures of the</p>
<p>trampled-down girls. The cloakroom was strewn with them. They were</p>
<p>on the sofas and some as limp as dolls propped up against chairs.</p>
<p>Bare arms and silk legs strewn at the haphazard angles of sawdust</p>
<p>dolls. You stepped among the debris of them.</p>
<p>The maniacal laughter of the jazz. You began to feel a little mad</p>
<p>with it yourself. Your brain was one of those Coney Island devices</p>
<p>for noise. Raz-z-z-z daz-z-z-z. The terrible sting of fumes against</p>
<p>your eyeballs. The rising simoon of the heat. The flung bare,</p>
<p>beautiful necks there--about--everywhere--and the wise impudent lips.</p>
<p>You stepped among the slim forms and propped them up and straightened</p>
<p>out the sawdust legs and ordered the tossed loveliness of chiffon</p>
<p>down over the legs. Raz-z-z-z daz-z-z-z. It helped as you pushed</p>
<p>through the fumes, to try and swing out on the short quick beats of</p>
<p>the brain, far away from what the hands did.</p>
<p>Somewhere, you tried to think--raz-z-z-z daz-z-z-z--somewhere, Lake</p>
<p>Como's twilights are deep purple. Slow purple like the widening wine</p>
<p>stain on a tablecloth. Raz-z-z-z daz-z-z-z. To lean out into that</p>
<p>thought. It was like opening a window. Slow twilights. The</p>
<p>standing forests with folded arms. To lean out--raz-z-z-z daz-z-z-z.</p>
<p>One girl asleep in a chair with neatly closed but fumy lips had to be</p>
<p>picked up as if she were a little bag of sachet, crammed into her</p>
<p>wrap and handed bodily to one of the young men with the irreverent</p>
<p>eyes. He left a dollar bill on the counter that separated the</p>
<p>cloakroom from the corridor. That was the beginning. Until dawn the</p>
<p>coins and a few more dollar bills showered there. There was a china</p>
<p>saucer for catching them in one of the dressing table drawers.</p>
<p>Bertha did not know that.</p>
<p>At four o'clock the jazz sort of reared itself up on its hind legs,</p>
<p>neighed enormously, and stopped like a great fantastic, fabled horse,</p>
<p>frozen there on his dancing haunches with horror at his bray.</p>
<p>The strange silence began to pour. It pressed on the eardrums. It</p>
<p>sang. A ringing silence as full of shuddering little atoms as a</p>
<p>brass gong after a beating. You tiptoed through it, picking up</p>
<p>oddments of a glove, a ribbon, a comb. The exhausted air was full of</p>
<p>fog. There were three thickness of brocade across the window and the</p>
<p>sash was hard to budge.</p>
<p>Finally, with all the strength of her, Bertha jerked it open. A wet</p>
<p>cool dawn blew in. You scooped your hands into it and laved it over</p>
<p>your face. Cool dawn that had traveled over wide and brooding</p>
<p>silences. You fell on your knees beside the open window and drank it</p>
<p>in as it pinkened.</p>
<p>It was time to go, but there was still one coat left on the rack. A</p>
<p>lovely one of pink silver and silver fox. The money made quite a wad</p>
<p>in Bertha's petticoat pocket. It was pleasant while you waited, to</p>
<p>walk about the room to the friendly hit-hit. It made the rising day</p>
<p>seem kindly. The little ducts in her mouth were running. The</p>
<p>hit-hit meant tripe stew for breakfast.</p>
<p>Bertha standing there in the ruins of that cluttered bejazzed night,</p>
<p>her silhouette against the new day....</p>
<p>A vacuum cleaner started to whine on a lower floor. The coat of pink</p>
<p>silver began to tarnish against the day. Voices. The girl with the</p>
<p>heart-shaped face and one of the young men with the patent leather</p>
<p>hair and the irreverent eyes. There had been so many of them.</p>
<p>Hundreds of them passing and repassing that door. You wanted to</p>
<p>laugh at the identical procession of them. A shirt front for a shirt</p>
<p>front. An eye for an eye. A silhouette for a silhouette. Hundreds</p>
<p>of the lean-faced young men. They had passed and they had passed</p>
<p>until there was only the one left. He was leaning up against the</p>
<p>door frame in an easy and insolent hypotenuse with his hands plunged</p>
<p>into his pockets and crawling about in there, and his easy face none</p>
<p>too steady, with the mouth off on its rhomboid every so often.</p>
<p>"_Chérie_, I adore you."</p>
<p>"Jerry, you darling villain."</p>
<p>"Get your wraps. I'll run down and get mine. Here's a dollar for</p>
<p>the Woolworth Tower."</p>
<p>"Grant's Tomb, darling."</p>
<p>"Hurry along, there's a girl."</p>
<p>"But Jerry--I----"</p>
<p>"Darling, haven't my two hours of eloquence upon the subject</p>
<p>convinced you that no one will ever know?"</p>
<p>"But the family--Jerry, and Father is so--so----"</p>
<p>"Will you leave all that to me, _Chérie_? Do you trust me enough?</p>
<p>You'll be home tucked in your little bed by the time your maid comes</p>
<p>in to draw your curtains. I want you, _Chérie_, with</p>
<p>me--to-night--my rooms--for an hour only----"</p>
<p>"Jerry."</p>
<p>"I'll be back with my coat ... wait, sit here, darling...."</p>
<p>"Oh, Jerry----"</p>
<p>"No, no--no nonsense--say to me, 'Yes, Jerry darling.' Say it</p>
<p>pretty, so I can kiss it off your lips."</p>
<p>"Yes--Jerry darling----"</p>
<p>The wrap of pink silver. She slid into it like a star into a cloud.</p>
<p>It was hard to tear your eyes off the pale, frightened beauty of her.</p>
<p>Somehow you wanted to keep her. Close. Close to your bigness. To</p>
<p>make her listen if she would, to the calmness, to the great calm tick</p>
<p>of your heart. Your eyes, you could not take them off. You stood</p>
<p>there drawing on her wrap for her. But your eyes. You could not</p>
<p>tear them off. Bertha, standing there big and pale and tranquil</p>
<p>against the daylight.</p>
<p>"You! Let go, please. What are you looking at?"</p>
<p>"I--why, miss----"</p>
<p>"You think I'm drunk. I'm not."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I won't be looked at like that. You hear me? I won't."</p>
<p>She began to cry. Tipsy little tears that ran down to the point of</p>
<p>her heart-shaped face.</p>
<p>"You! I won't be looked at like that. I hate it. I won't have it.</p>
<p>I want to go home."</p>
<p>"Go----"</p>
<p>"Tell him--the young man--tell him when he comes that I've gone.</p>
<p>Tell him I left the message. I've gone home. I--you--I hate you for</p>
<p>staring like that. I won't have it. I want to go home...."</p>
<p>She gathered the shimmer of wrap all about her and ran down the</p>
<p>right-hand curve of the staircase. You could follow the shimmer of</p>
<p>her through the mirror. The shimmer--the whine of the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>The empty cloakroom, it was the color of cloyed grease. Presently he</p>
<p>came.</p>
<p>"Where----"</p>
<p>"She's gone----"</p>
<p>"Gone where----"</p>
<p>"Gone----"</p>
<p>"Hell," he said and started toward the right staircase.</p>
<p>"No. No. Wait. She'll be back in yoost a minute. Wait here, she</p>
<p>said."</p>
<p>"Oh." He sat down a little unsteadily.</p>
<p>She closed the window so that the heat crowded up again. Tiptoe.</p>
<p>Her movements about the room had a slow sedative rhythm. Tiptoe.</p>
<p>There was a corsage of double Parma violets kicked under a table and</p>
<p>dying into the heat. She picked it up and placed it on the table at</p>
<p>his elbow. Slow tease of perfume. His eyelids began to wave like an</p>
<p>old green frog's. Finally, he slumped over sidewise. Asleep.</p>
<p>Bertha, tiptoeing out, with her lips lifted back off her shining</p>
<p>square teeth.</p>
<p>It was sun-up when she came out into the street. Even the city can</p>
<p>be sweet with morning. She strode through the tender light, the</p>
<p>bold, reassuring hit-hit against her leg. There was a certain Quick</p>
<p>Lunch Room on Lexington Avenue. Tripe stew. The juices along the</p>
<p>sides of her tongue were running.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The half-days were humiliating. They were the crumbs from the</p>
<p>agencies. Almost invariably they fell to the frieze of the</p>
<p>charwomen. One day for the first time one of these part-time</p>
<p>allotments fell to Bertha. Fell like a clod of fear. She took it</p>
<p>and went out with her shoulders round, and the slip of paper clutched</p>
<p>in her dread smitten fingers.</p>
<p>It was as if you had passed a milestone. An old stump of a milestone</p>
<p>all worn down and shaped like the last tooth of one of the scrubwomen.</p>
<p>The morning's work was in an automobile showroom on Fifty-ninth</p>
<p>Street near Columbus Circle. Polishing brass railings and the</p>
<p>mirrors nailed to the floor underneath the motor cars to reflect</p>
<p>their lowermost perfections. A soft morning of mousy little rubbings</p>
<p>along smooth surfaces. At two o'clock the workaday was finished. A</p>
<p>sun-drenched spring day swam over the Park and along the streets that</p>
<p>were running with new thaw. Women wore bright hats and overshoes.</p>
<p>What snow remained had great gaps in it that widened, and everywhere</p>
<p>little rivulets were hurrying toward the gutters. It was pleasant</p>
<p>just to stroll.</p>
<p>At Carnegie Hall on Fifty-seventh Street the motor cars were dense</p>
<p>and the bright hats were bobbing. Traffic ran toward the great</p>
<p>building in spokes. Up from the subways. Down from the elevated</p>
<p>trains. Along the side streets. Out from the motors. Concert</p>
<p>crowds. Bertha knew. Madam Gerbhardt had once given her the tickets</p>
<p>to the Ukrainian Chorus.</p>
<p>The crowd hit into you from all sides. You began to elbow. The</p>
<p>broad steps were crammed and everyone's face was uplifted. Two</p>
<p>policemen swung benign clubs. This was a kid-glove crowd with a</p>
<p>scent and a rustle to it. Once the swirl tightened so that no one</p>
<p>could move, but everybody swayed. The well-bred little squeals of</p>
<p>the women. The firm, well-clad arms of the men forging ahead for</p>
<p>them. Slamming of motor doors. Slow pouring upward of the crowd on</p>
<p>the steps. The eager, fluty voices of the women....</p>
<p>The swirl held Bertha like a vise. The women, ever so slightly, and</p>
<p>kindly enough, veered a little from the contact with her worn old</p>
<p>reefer. It was horrible in the spring light. Like a scab. You had</p>
<p>to hold yourself away from it by breathing in. Bertha could do that</p>
<p>until it almost seemed a mere box, with herself quite slimly and</p>
<p>fastidiously down its center.</p>
<p>Something curious happened. A child caught down in the jam had his</p>
<p>face crushed up softly against the reefer. His mother slid in a</p>
<p>quick hand between his cheek and the contact.</p>
<p>"Daddy," she said, "see if you cannot lift Junior over on your side.</p>
<p>Don't touch, Junior. Ugh, darling, not nice. Come over on this side</p>
<p>with Daddy--don't touch lady's coat."</p>
<p>She was as snug as a plover and as plump. Sweet fleshed. Something</p>
<p>eupeptic about her. Something about her....</p>
<p>"Go over to Daddy and Brother Ben." she said and veered. The veering</p>
<p>women.</p>
<p>The father lifted the child. His smile was very white in a brown</p>
<p>face. Liver spotted eyes....</p>
<p>"Come, Junior Boy," he said, "away from there. Here, Mother, you</p>
<p>come too. Away."</p>
<p>It was the Musliners. The firm pat tight little group of them. You</p>
<p>watched them edge up the steps with the crowd.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the spring made you hate that reefer. So with simulated</p>
<p>unconsciousness you looked over the heads of the veering women as you</p>
<p>tried to force your way through. And over the heads of the veering</p>
<p>women you saw a picture. A lithograph pasted on to a panel beside</p>
<p>the entrance. It stood out like the spot cast by a sun glass. It</p>
<p>riveted the eye. Willy-nilly the crowds jammed around. Bertha with</p>
<p>her big hands and wrists hanging bare in a huddle in front and her</p>
<p>gaze sucked up against the lithograph in the panel.</p>
<p>The spot that stood out as if cast by a sun glass was a head. It</p>
<p>leaned out over one shoulder and then everything was black, like a</p>
<p>silence, until farther down over the keyboard of a piano were two</p>
<p>hands. You wanted to cry. Such ineffably tender hands. Why--why</p>
<p>the white hands at your heart! There they were. And that head</p>
<p>leaning over one shoulder out of that background of silence. That</p>
<p>luminous, tawny-looking head with the long tender cheeks and the eyes</p>
<p>that looked tranced with the music of the chimes goldily. Who? The</p>
<p>name ran in script across the corner. Charvet.</p>
<p>Ah, Charvet. That evening at dinner. Madam Gerbhardt.</p>
<p>Moon-haunted. To be moon-haunted was to live with an opal mist about</p>
<p>the heart....</p>
<p>It was so hard to move. The eyes held so. They held, with that</p>
<p>feeling of suction....</p>
<p>"Move on."</p>
<p>There was still something of the sixteen dollars in that petticoat</p>
<p>pocket. Friendly little wad. It burned. It made your body glow</p>
<p>suddenly like a hot coin. An excoriating kind of heat that made your</p>
<p>lips feel cracked and your eyes glossy.</p>
<p>The crowd bent up the steps. There was a long line before the box</p>
<p>office. It moved up inch by inch, and Bertha, suddenly a part of it,</p>
<p>moved too. The wad was tied into a handkerchief and it had to be</p>
<p>bitten open with the teeth.</p>
<p>"Ticket please."</p>
<p>"Admission only."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Standing room only. One dollar."</p>
<p>"Yah...."</p>
<p>You slid in through a baize door. The auditorium was dim and</p>
<p>enormous and the waiting silence all arched up like a cat's back.</p>
<p>The stage was so far--off somewhere beyond the intervening sea of all</p>
<p>the soft breathings. You could see a little, if you tiptoed to peer</p>
<p>between the heads. The piano. A curve of black. The white hands.</p>
<p>The ineffably tender hands. Heart flutters that had flown out there.</p>
<p>Someone rammed in ahead, pressing you there against the wall.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Illustration: Music fragment]</p>
<p>The shelving slipping beach. The white keys ran down it with the</p>
<p>purr of surf. You could feel the floor of sand moving out subtly</p>
<p>from under your feet. The floor that led under the sea.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bertha standing pinioned there to the wall with her hands caught up</p>
<p>and crowded to her breast by the crush of the standees and her throat</p>
<p>flexed outward and beating. It was like bleeding. As if the</p>
<p>melodies of her heart were arteries and that running of the keys out</p>
<p>there the precious bleeding of them. It was like that. Oh, it</p>
<p>was....</p>
<p>[Illustration: Music fragment]</p>
<p>The tears came out in a dew along your eyes.</p>
<p>[Illustration: Music fragment]</p>
<p>It stepped down the keys in heartbeats. You could scarcely keep</p>
<p>back. You knew that cry. It had lain in your heart for so long.</p>
<p>There it was on the outside of yourself, strewn along the keys. You</p>
<p>were free of the hurt of it--where it had lodged like a knife in the</p>
<p>plushy case of your heart.</p>
<p>The bleeding out of all the little inner turmoils. The dammed-up</p>
<p>ecstasies. The music of the chimes goldily. The glad releases. The</p>
<p>rilling beauty. The white hands at your heart. Just by tilting</p>
<p>yourself up tiptoe you could see them flown out there above the keys.</p>
<p>The white flutterings. To be pinioned there against the wall all of</p>
<p>that afternoon with your hands caught up against your breast and the</p>
<p>arteries of your heart uncocked and flowing....</p>
<p>The applause beat itself out and then began all over again. It died</p>
<p>down and then, on the momentum of a few little scattered claps, rose</p>
<p>again. The crowd loosened and moved down the aisle, blackening and</p>
<p>jamming around the platform. The cramming against the wall eased up.</p>
<p>You could hurry, too, if you wanted.</p>
<p>But is was enough, just to remain there against the wall with the</p>
<p>eyes closed and the throat flexing. She could no more have</p>
<p>moved--down there--those white hands--the white hands at her</p>
<p>heart--down there--fluttering. She could no more have moved....</p>
<p>It was enough to be standing back there against the wall weak and</p>
<p>glad.</p>
<p>It did not matter that her eyes somehow could not open to see the</p>
<p>face of Felix Charvet down there beyond the opal mist, the face with</p>
<p>the chimes tranced so goldily in the eyes and the long, choir-boy</p>
<p>cheeks that were lit with their first faint down.</p>
<p>It did not matter, now that she felt so glad and weak and bled free</p>
<p>of those lovely torments that were without dimension ... it did not</p>
<p>matter that she was never to know that Felix Charvet was Felix--son</p>
<p>of Rollo.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was frightening to see the houses board up and the exodus of the</p>
<p>families set in. Summer. Truck loads of perilously piled trunks.</p>
<p>Nonplussed cats mewling at sealed doors. Handbills collecting on</p>
<p>stoops in little snow drifts.</p>
<p>The agencies began to crowd.</p>
<p>The room in Desbrosses Street was as black and as narrow as a flue</p>
<p>and all day it drew in the heat and all night long breathed it out.</p>
<p>There was a window, but it opened upon a brick wall that you could</p>
<p>touch without leaning. The darkness seemed to embalm the heat.</p>
<p>Dreadful furry thickness like the fuzz on the tongue of a fever</p>
<p>patient.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night, Bertha dragged herself to the sill and crouched</p>
<p>on the floor with her cheek to it. The wall breathed like a flank.</p>
<p>If you looked straight up there was a bit of sky about the size of a</p>
<p>quill. On certain nights a star wandered into it. It made Bertha</p>
<p>laugh to see it. Like a wise eye to a keyhole. Until she fell</p>
<p>asleep Bertha gazed, eye to eye.</p>
<p>But this very slit of a room was the reason why it was frightening to</p>
<p>see the houses board up. Its rental was a dollar a week and with the</p>
<p>exodus to the country even part time work with the families, scarcer</p>
<p>and scarcer.</p>
<p>Once she did jump a week and the agent who collected each Saturday</p>
<p>into a dirty canvas bag with a drawstring showed a tooth at her. A</p>
<p>sort of fang and the more terrifying because she had thought his gums</p>
<p>were empty.</p>
<p>One day an innkeeper engaging a staff for his back street little</p>
<p>hostelry in Asbury Park debated between Bertha and a great green</p>
<p>Swedish girl who spoke no English, but whose lips hung down like ripe</p>
<p>plums.</p>
<p>For the life of him he could not decide. Bertha sitting back in the</p>
<p>frieze kept saying something that was her little prayer.</p>
<p>"Please make him," she kept saying--"please make him."</p>
<p>The bald spot on his head was all crimson and beaten from the sun.</p>
<p>It must have taken a good warm sun through clean salted air to do</p>
<p>that. Asbury Park. Please make him. Please make him.</p>
<p>"You're too old," he said finally and turned to lay his hand on the</p>
<p>Swedish girl's hip.</p>
<p>_You're too old. You're too old. You're too old_. The phrase was</p>
<p>so sly. It ran after you like a shadow. It would never let you be.</p>
<p>But that same day there came along a week of half-days at Coronation</p>
<p>Point Inn. Airing rooms preparatory to the opening of the season.</p>
<p>Prying closed windows from their winter stripping. Swabbing floors</p>
<p>and unswathing the wrapped bedsteads which were hung slightly from</p>
<p>the floor, against winter dampness.</p>
<p>Oh, but it was pleasant. Coronation Point stood on a terrace and</p>
<p>overlooked a curve of bay. You took a subway to the end of the line</p>
<p>and then a surface car and then you walked fifteen minutes through</p>
<p>sun-shot leafage that speckled the road and made it dance. Chipmunks</p>
<p>made precious noises scuttling over leaves. Orioles the color of the</p>
<p>batting of an eye flashed through. Tit-a-weet of cock robin. And</p>
<p>smells. The damp lush ones of sun making moist places steam and the</p>
<p>green ones of stems when they are snapped in two and bleed. The</p>
<p>green smells came from a little tramp stream of new water without</p>
<p>even a bed for itself which ran through the grasses. It had a trill.</p>
<p>It made the morning a hurrying loveliness. Quick, delicate, tumbling</p>
<p>thing--sometimes on the homeward walk, Bertha took off her shoes and</p>
<p>stockings, stooped for a handful of skirt and waded in against its</p>
<p>tiny tide. The toes bit down and the mud squnched up....</p>
<p>Where the woods left off, the highway and hot little wooden houses</p>
<p>took up. Then it was hot! Trudging along toward the surface car,</p>
<p>motors tore along that macadam road, so that it was best to walk on</p>
<p>the little rim of cinders at the edge. That was the worst of the</p>
<p>half-day at Coronation Point. The half pay and the walk back to the</p>
<p>surface car through the blazing noon.</p>
<p>Sometimes in front of the occasional frame houses there were wooden</p>
<p>planks. They eased the feet of the burn from the macadam and before</p>
<p>a shanty that had been rigged up as a gasoline station, an old</p>
<p>overturned chassis, rotting there through sun and storm, was at least</p>
<p>a resting place.</p>
<p>A hot, bald-faced little shanty-town squatting there on the bare clay</p>
<p>stretch beyond the surface cars. You could see the tracks shining in</p>
<p>the distance like forceps and on clear days the minarets of the city.</p>
<p>Children and hens wallowed themselves out dust-baths in the patches</p>
<p>of yard before these houses. The women were slattern. But sometimes</p>
<p>there were neat corrugated truck gardens. Ruffles of lettuce.</p>
<p>Lattice work of peas. Ridged potato patches like the roof of a</p>
<p>mouth. Tough, good-smelling gardens. Just to trudge past them could</p>
<p>set the knife blades of hunger to slashing in Bertha.</p>
<p>There was a bake shop farther along. A dilapidated little packing</p>
<p>case of a building, with a brood of dirty children wallowing in the</p>
<p>back yard and a weedy truck garden that had somehow been eked out of</p>
<p>the clay.</p>
<p>MEYERBOGEN'S BAKERY. LUNCH ROOM.</p>
<p>CROTON'S ICE CREAM SOLD HERE.</p>
<p>Its breath was so sweet. The fragrance of hot bread. You could</p>
<p>smell it as you came along the road. It teased at Bertha's</p>
<p>faintness. It made the noonday road turn into a garter snake that</p>
<p>rippled. The swimming, buzzing bread-scented haze. One day, because</p>
<p>it was unendurable to wait for the three o'clock tripe stew in the</p>
<p>city, which must serve as lunch and dinner, she turned in.</p>
<p>A mat of flies clung to the screen door and buzzed off as she opened</p>
<p>it. There was a table near the door with a mustard pot on it. The</p>
<p>bread and rolls on the counter were covered with pink netting. The</p>
<p>proprietor served. He was enormous. A white apron girded his</p>
<p>middle. His white cap was awry on his curly head. You saw him</p>
<p>through a fog of flour. Great fellow, most of the objects in the</p>
<p>shop shook as he walked. The T of chandelier that hung down in the</p>
<p>show window of tilted loaves of bread. The coffee mugs on the shelf.</p>
<p>A stack of saucers.</p>
<p>"Veenie sandwiches, five zents. Baked beans, five zents. Gorned</p>
<p>beef hash vid boached egg, fiveteen."</p>
<p>"Beans."</p>
<p>"Coffee?"</p>
<p>"Yah...."</p>
<p>The noonday buzzed with the flies and the broken little shouts of the</p>
<p>children. It was hard not to doze as she waited. Once her head did</p>
<p>fall forward.</p>
<p>"It's a hot day," said Meyerbogen the baker, and set down a brown</p>
<p>dish of the beans with a pale cube of pork on top.</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>Suddenly it was hard to eat. Even while her nostrils flared with the</p>
<p>need of the strong hot food the heat was full of disks, spinning</p>
<p>little juggler's plates and the shouts of the children were so far</p>
<p>away--so far----</p>
<p>"Here--quick! You going to vaint? No. Don't. Here--drink----"</p>
<p>"I--where----"</p>
<p>"It's all right. You god a liddle stroke from the zun. Here, sit</p>
<p>while I fan you."</p>
<p>The noonday drone swam back again. It was good to feel it, hot and</p>
<p>buzzing and full of the shouts of the children.</p>
<p>"I'm all right," she said, and shook herself like a spaniel, and</p>
<p>looked up at Meyerbogen with the blue channels of her eyes.</p>
<p>"You're all right, sure, now," he said and went off on his waddle</p>
<p>about the business of unstacking buns from a wooden tray which a</p>
<p>helper had just brought up from a basement.</p>
<p>But the lunch. For the life of her the beans would not go down or</p>
<p>the cup of the light tan coffee. That was terrible. To feel all</p>
<p>warm again and free of the chill of cold sweat and back safely once</p>
<p>more in the drone of the noon and the lunch spread out on the clean</p>
<p>wooden top of the table, untasted. Waste. The half days made one</p>
<p>calculate so. Inevitably the slashing blades of hunger that cut</p>
<p>through and through the great organism of Bertha would begin to champ</p>
<p>again, a little later and the day's food allotment was already spent</p>
<p>down to the last penny. Slowly and against a restricted throat she</p>
<p>began to swallow the coffee.</p>
<p>Presently Meyerbogen sat down on the chair opposite.</p>
<p>"It's a heat," he said and the fog of the flour rose up off him.</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>He was like a great milk-fed baby. Pink polished cheeks. Tight,</p>
<p>spring-tight curls and fat hands with dimples. And the enormous</p>
<p>girth of him! He swayed back from himself for all the world like a</p>
<p>tenor drinking in breath for Pagliacci's sob. And, ridiculously</p>
<p>enough, he was almost dainty.</p>
<p>His big white throat was soft, and when he laughed he shook from head</p>
<p>to toe, and the cloud of flour exuded as if someone were beating him</p>
<p>with a baby's cornstarch bag.</p>
<p>"You lost your abbidite?"</p>
<p>"Yah--a little----"</p>
<p>"Take your time----"</p>
<p>"The heat----"</p>
<p>"Yah--yah---the heat--my woman--she died on me in heat like this."</p>
<p>He looked off toward the roadway and screwed up his face. There was</p>
<p>something about him actually of a baby about to cry.</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"Meningitis," he said--"down two days----"</p>
<p>"Oh--oh----"</p>
<p>"A good woman. Never down with child more than three days--and then</p>
<p>in two days--meningitis--gone----"</p>
<p>"Oh--oh----"</p>
<p>"Five of them needing her. From two years old to ten."</p>
<p>"The children?"</p>
<p>"Yah--we had it neat like a pin here once. Now look!--I had a good</p>
<p>woman----"</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>His great baby face was still screwed and resolutely out toward the</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>"Zummer," he said cryptically, "is zummer. It's good but not too</p>
<p>much----"</p>
<p>Foolishly you could have cried for him. Big baby.</p>
<p>"Some zinnamon buns? Just hot from the ofen."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>He waddled out on the porch and began carrying a sack of flour around</p>
<p>the side entrance. You could hear him wheeze and the white haze was</p>
<p>everywhere. Gradually it was pleasant to be eating. The coarse,</p>
<p>strong food--the steam of it was appetizing, and after the first</p>
<p>forkfuls appetite came back.</p>
<p>Clank. Clank. One of the children wandered in. Oh, how your heart</p>
<p>leaped back, wounded. He had a poor little leg in a brace that</p>
<p>clanked. A fat baby, too, only it was as if the father resembled the</p>
<p>child and not the child the father. A dirty baby. A not nice baby.</p>
<p>Eggy. With a smeared and too-large little girl's dress hung on him</p>
<p>and horrid, dirt-ground underthings. He was lugging something. A</p>
<p>man's ground down and discarded shoe that he must have found in the</p>
<p>roadway.</p>
<p>"Shoe," he said and held it out toward Bertha.</p>
<p>"Ugh, dirty," she said, and made a grimace.</p>
<p>"Dirty," he said, and made an identical grimace with his already</p>
<p>dirt-grimaced face, and took the shoe by thumb and forefinger and</p>
<p>threw it out of the door.</p>
<p>That was adorable and made you want to pinch the dirty little cheek.</p>
<p>"Lady?"</p>
<p>She lifted him up and sat him rather gingerly on the knee of her neat</p>
<p>skirt. The brace bit through and down into her flesh. It was</p>
<p>heavier than the child. Cruel. Sickening.</p>
<p>"Baby."</p>
<p>"Lady."</p>
<p>Meyerbogen came in. There were lines of perspiration running down</p>
<p>his face.</p>
<p>"Chimmie," he said, "go back out in the yard. Get down off the</p>
<p>missis. Here's a zinnamon bun."</p>
<p>"It's all right."</p>
<p>"He's dirty. I can't ged help in the gountry."</p>
<p>"Yah--dirty."</p>
<p>"I'm dirty," said Jimmie, and looked up at her with his clear eyes</p>
<p>shining in their smeary sockets. The brace cut in.</p>
<p>"I'll wash him."</p>
<p>"Ach--blease--"</p>
<p>"Where is the----"</p>
<p>"Ach, no, but you ain't so good yourself with zunstroke----"</p>
<p>"I'm all right. Where?"</p>
<p>"Back there."</p>
<p>"Come, Chimmie."</p>
<p>Clank. Clank.</p>
<p>Incredible disorder of that room behind the shop. The fantastic</p>
<p>confusion of a chair sitting crazily on a carpet sofa. A red hen had</p>
<p>wandered in through a hole in the screen door. The dishes of what</p>
<p>seemed many a breakfast were stacked on the table and half covered</p>
<p>with the flung-up edges of the red tablecloth. Flies. There were</p>
<p>swiss curtains at the windows, but they had dried on their poles into</p>
<p>strings. A pet tortoise hung halfway up one. Boys' caps and flung</p>
<p>off aprons and half a basket of new dug potatoes. A broken high</p>
<p>chair. Dumped-out coffee grounds. Sack of grass seed. A child's</p>
<p>slate hung on the wall with this chirography in the nonsense hand of</p>
<p>boyhood.</p>
<p>[Illustration: The Meyerbogens]</p>
<p>It made the disorder suddenly not so terrible. It made you want to</p>
<p>laugh.</p>
<p>Poor little Jimmie. He was so dirty. The smudge ran deep down into</p>
<p>his pores and he cried at the rubbing. The brace was hard to lift</p>
<p>off. Meyerbogen knew the device and did that, and the welts on the</p>
<p>plump curving leg were so deep that you kissed them.</p>
<p>"He can ged all right. The doctor says he needs to be shown two</p>
<p>hours every day how to walk so he don't throw his little leg out. I</p>
<p>don't ged the time."</p>
<p>You kissed them again, the red fiery welts.</p>
<p>"I can ged all right." That was his way. The little mimic!</p>
<p>There were no towels and Meyerbogen ran downstairs into the basement</p>
<p>where the baking ovens were, for some flour sacks, but while he was</p>
<p>gone, Bertha found a clean bed sheet and rolled Jimmie into it.</p>
<p>He came out as round and as plump as a mushroom.</p>
<p>"O-o-o-o-o."</p>
<p>"O-o-o-o-o."</p>
<p>Patty-pat-pat up and down the bare back.</p>
<p>The children came trooping in. Three of them in dirty little steps.</p>
<p>Oscar and Petey and Essie. Meyerbogens all. Dumpy. Thick. Sturdy.</p>
<p>The girl had two beautiful brown braids that she could sit on. Oscar</p>
<p>and Pete were just shaved, like little convicts.</p>
<p>"We gotta house-girl. We gotta house-girl."</p>
<p>"Shut up. It's only a gustomer gifing us help."</p>
<p>"I'll stay. I do day work."</p>
<p>"Ach, if you knew how I need help. I'll pay good."</p>
<p>There was a clean dress found for Jimmie. Almost immediately he fell</p>
<p>asleep and the chair was lifted down off the carpet couch so that</p>
<p>Bertha could stretch him out there. The children drifted off. You</p>
<p>could hear the pleasant treble of them all through the somnolent</p>
<p>afternoon. Thin, high incessant talk of children. Meyerbogen was</p>
<p>downstairs baking. Once he called up for one of the large tin trays</p>
<p>from the shop. Bertha carried it down. It was clean and full of the</p>
<p>sweet hot breath down there in the basement, and one of the two</p>
<p>helpers kept stoking the roaring ovens. Meyerbogen, leaning back</p>
<p>from himself, enormous and flour-dusted and pink in the face. He</p>
<p>lunged at the dough with a rolling pin; flattened it to a mat,</p>
<p>flopped over the mat, lunged. The smell was strong. Full of life.</p>
<p>Firm sweet bread. It was the realest smell of all. Almost with</p>
<p>dimension. Bread.</p>
<p>"It's no blace down here in this heat for you. Go right back. You</p>
<p>had a touch from the zun."</p>
<p>It was hard to know where to begin. The four tiny bedrooms up under</p>
<p>the hot eaves were wrathy-looking with confusion. The tossed</p>
<p>children's beds. What had once been neat enough carpets had rents in</p>
<p>them where children's feet had skated. More of the once dainty</p>
<p>curtains had sagged on their rods. The room where the boys slept was</p>
<p>filled with the bulk of an elaborately contrived aeroplane. You had</p>
<p>to climb around it to get at the window to open it. There was not</p>
<p>enough fresh bed-linen but finally Bertha found a chest of it tucked</p>
<p>away in a small slanting garret over the back porch.</p>
<p>A neat, old-world trunk full of coarse, carefully laundered linens,</p>
<p>some with cotton crochet. Homely, strong things that the wife of</p>
<p>Meyerbogen must have hemmed, crocheted, laundered, and packed away.</p>
<p>They made all the tumbled-looking beds in that house seem suddenly</p>
<p>cool, as if the mother of the Meyerbogens had laid a placid hand</p>
<p>suddenly on the hot tossed brow of her household.</p>
<p>And Meyerbogen's room, with the great solemn walnut bed and the</p>
<p>wardrobe that just grazed the ceiling. The wife of Meyerbogen had</p>
<p>given life four times on that ugly brown bed. She must have been a</p>
<p>strong woman. An odor still hung over the room. The green and milky</p>
<p>sweetness of cows' breath when they lick their calves. Something had</p>
<p>happened to the mirror over the dresser. It had come unscrewed and</p>
<p>stood with its face to a corner. There was a chair rigged up beside</p>
<p>the bed with a bit of looking-glass as jagged as lightning propped up</p>
<p>against it and a razor and a shaving mug stiff with old suds beside</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Great baby of a Meyerbogen. It must have made him red to bursting to</p>
<p>stoop to shave. Bertha found out the trouble with the mirror against</p>
<p>the wall. Its screws were threadbare. It was not easy to stand on a</p>
<p>chair and unhinge the top ruffle of mill-work that made the wardrobe</p>
<p>just graze the ceiling, and take out its screws and lean it against</p>
<p>the wall and drag back the mirror for mounting on the dresser. It</p>
<p>was a man's job, and a great pox of sweat broke out as she hoisted</p>
<p>and screwed. It was astonishing, though, how it seemed to quiet the</p>
<p>room of its state of confusion. That adjusted mirror and the made</p>
<p>bed. There was little hope to do more in that afternoon than to</p>
<p>untie the strings of swiss curtains from someone's attempt to get</p>
<p>them up out of the way, and pin up one of the neat "splashers" that</p>
<p>came out of the trunk behind the washstand. It was especially</p>
<p>designed for there. An oblong of white crash with a little girl and</p>
<p>a little boy embroidered in red and underneath in scrolled red</p>
<p>script, "Good Morning."</p>
<p>It made the room begin to shine.</p>
<p>At long intervals the screen door to the shop slammed and the bell</p>
<p>tittered. You could hear Meyerbogen lumbering up the cellar stairs.</p>
<p>The house shuddered. Or sometimes one of the children ran around</p>
<p>from the side yard across the wooden porch, slamming the kitchen</p>
<p>screen sharply.</p>
<p>By late afternoon the beds were at least fresh and made and the</p>
<p>dishes washed and a clean red cloth laid out on the table. Four</p>
<p>hours of hoisting, scrubbing, straightening, that had scarcely made</p>
<p>their dent. The red hen still clucked among the stove cinders and</p>
<p>would not remain shooed out. And Jimmie. Constantly in and out</p>
<p>through the hole in the screening he was lurid again with dirt. The</p>
<p>crusty dirt of damp little hands and clay and unsavory objects about</p>
<p>the yard.</p>
<p>"Chimmie, you bane all dirty!"</p>
<p>"Chimmie bane all dirty." Clank. Clank.</p>
<p>There was something about that little way of repeating your phrases.</p>
<p>You held him very closely. The brace made him so heavy.</p>
<p>Meyerbogen was generous.</p>
<p>"Here is three dollars! You done a big day's work in a few hours."</p>
<p>"Oh, no----."</p>
<p>"Oh yes. Could you, blease, come to-morrow all day?"</p>
<p>"I got morning work promised at Coronation Point."</p>
<p>"To-morrow afternoon, then. Part time like to-day?"</p>
<p>"Yah----."</p>
<p>"Dot's good. You can stay for zupper now, if you want."</p>
<p>"Oh no--no----."</p>
<p>The shy inexplicability of that. She wanted to stay for supper. She</p>
<p>wanted to putter over the stove with Essie. There was a great</p>
<p>dish-pan of greens with the dirt from the garden still brown against</p>
<p>their roots on the sink, and a ham end. Chimmie's low little body</p>
<p>down there about her knees. The boys tussling out in the dust. It</p>
<p>was pleasant there in that room with the new red tablecloth. The</p>
<p>late sun slanted in through the screen and one step down led right</p>
<p>out into the weed-ridden kitchen garden with the thin leafage of the</p>
<p>peas stuck on sticks against the pinkening sky.</p>
<p>"You live in the city, not?"</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>"It's a long way."</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>"I bay carfare."</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>"You won't dissaboint--to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Dot's good. I need help, blease. It's a confusion----"</p>
<p>"I'll come."</p>
<p>"Good night."</p>
<p>"Good night."</p>
<p>The sun was gone. The road back to the city was like a long gray</p>
<p>river and the light on the forceps of car tracks had died.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The bread. Every noon of that week as you came down from Coronation</p>
<p>Point Inn, the smell ran out a little ways to meet you and the treble</p>
<p>shouts of the children and once Essie with her pigtails, came flying.</p>
<p>"Bertha's here. Bertha's here."</p>
<p>Why, that was a greeting! The words ran down your spine. Bertha's</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>"Say, oughtta see. Chimmie fell off the counter and shinnied his</p>
<p>nose."</p>
<p>"Oh Essie----"</p>
<p>"It bled."</p>
<p>"Oh----"</p>
<p>"Papa couldn't make it stop. Papa can't do nothing. Blood makes him</p>
<p>sick."</p>
<p>"Oh, Chimmie, Chimmie. Where is he?"</p>
<p>"There he is, laying out in the road. Get up, you. Papa will get</p>
<p>you. Automobile will get you."</p>
<p>"Oh, Chimmie, you got hurt?"</p>
<p>"Chimmie got hurt. Look."</p>
<p>Clank. Clank. There was a great wad of cotton across his nose, held</p>
<p>there precariously with strips of adhesive plaster. The brace that</p>
<p>made him twice too heavy. And now his shinnied nose. You pulled</p>
<p>back the cotton. It stuck and already some of the grime from the</p>
<p>smeared little face was under.</p>
<p>There was a long siege of washing with the warm water from the basin</p>
<p>that Essie held, and Pete tore off the hem of one of Meyerbogen's</p>
<p>clean handkerchiefs and Oscar stood by with the vaseline.</p>
<p>So! The little dressing on Chimmie's nose was neater and flatter and</p>
<p>cleaner. It made you glad, the neat little flatness and cleanness.</p>
<p>"Now, Chimmie's well."</p>
<p>"Now, Chimmie's well."</p>
<p>The children ran off. There were the curtains to be hung. They had</p>
<p>been washed and ironed the day before and lay out, waiting.</p>
<p>Meyerbogen came around the side of the house with a sack of flour on</p>
<p>his back. The white fog made him dim.</p>
<p>"You, Bertha?"</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>"Dot's good."</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>"Want lunch?"</p>
<p>"Yah, but I can fix it----"</p>
<p>"No, I'll fix. Veenie sandwich. Baked beans. Corned beef hash with</p>
<p>boached egg."</p>
<p>"Beans."</p>
<p>It was pleasant at the little table in the bake shop. The motors</p>
<p>spun past and left a little trail of quiet after the whizz. The mat</p>
<p>of flies clung to the screen door but could not force in. The bread.</p>
<p>The sweet rich smell of it from the ovens beneath. The beans were</p>
<p>fragrant too.</p>
<p>Meyerbogen sat down opposite. His knees were very short and very</p>
<p>wide apart and his great paunch threw him sway-back, so that he could</p>
<p>not see them. Pouf! Out came the little fog of flour when he sat.</p>
<p>His spring-tight curls and his eyelashes were all gray with it.</p>
<p>Pouf! Out came a little fog when his hand struck the table. A short</p>
<p>hand as dainty as a woman's and all bleached and soft from knuckling</p>
<p>into the dough.</p>
<p>"It's a heat," he said.</p>
<p>"Yah."</p>
<p>"Want some mustard?"</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"Chimmie shinnied his nose."</p>
<p>"You didn't know how to dress it."</p>
<p>"Blood goes against me----"</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"Want some mustard?"</p>
<p>"I got some."</p>
<p>"You fixed it good."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Chimmie's nose."</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>"It takes a woman. I can't keep help in the gountry. Since my woman</p>
<p>is--gone, I got only confusion."</p>
<p>"They don't need me no more at Coronation Point."</p>
<p>"If, blease, you could come by us. There is a good room for you</p>
<p>upstairs and----"</p>
<p>"By the week, you mean?"</p>
<p>"By the month. By the--always, if you would blease. I can pay...."</p>
<p>"Yah...."</p>
<p>"It ain't easy to find such a woman like you. The children, they</p>
<p>like you. There is dot something about you--they know it always</p>
<p>first. Children do."</p>
<p>"I can come."</p>
<p>"Dot's good. Oh, dot is very good. The confusion, it's bad. I need</p>
<p>a woman. You. We would treat you like one of the family."</p>
<p>"Yah----"</p>
<p>The drone of high noon. The treble of the children. The little</p>
<p>shining of the beads of sweat on Meyerbogen's nose.</p>
<p>He began to shamble out. Presently you could see him walking around</p>
<p>the side of the house, bent, with a sack of flour on his back.</p>
<p>Family. A snug kind of a word. Like a new reefer that buttoned you</p>
<p>in up the front. Only the buttons this time were Chimmie's eyes.</p>
<p>Family. A snug kind of a word.</p>
<p>There were the curtains to be hung. They were very starched and</p>
<p>stood away from the windows, and more than ever the rooms began to</p>
<p>shine.</p>
<p>The dining room was the best. The red tablecloth helped and a potted</p>
<p>petunia, revived a bit with watering, stood in the center. The red</p>
<p>rooster was a trial. Finally, you had to sit on the floor and shir</p>
<p>together a piece of red calico and hang it for a curtain across the</p>
<p>lower half of the screen. For some reason the tortoise chose that to</p>
<p>cling to now. Four times he had to be returned to his place under</p>
<p>the stove. Petey's tortoise was named Pete. Once when Bertha</p>
<p>exclaimed at him, for clinging to the new red curtain, Petey himself</p>
<p>came running.</p>
<p>"Want me?"</p>
<p>"Not you. I meant Pete under the stove."</p>
<p>"Gimme piece of bread and apple sauce?"</p>
<p>"Here."</p>
<p>"M-m-m-m."</p>
<p>His shaved yellow head. You ran your hand around and around its</p>
<p>bristliness and could feel his temples munching.</p>
<p>"Ouch."</p>
<p>"Don't run so hard, Petey."</p>
<p>"Aw quit. What you taking that down for? That's my slate, with my</p>
<p>drawing on it. Give me."</p>
<p>"I yoost want to wipe down the wall, Petey, I'll hang it back."</p>
<p>"Give me. Where's my slate pencil?"</p>
<p>"Here."</p>
<p>He curled himself up in a corner. You could hear the soft stalkings</p>
<p>of the pencil across the slate. The walls had to be brushed down</p>
<p>with a broom with a cloth tied about it. They were very dusty.</p>
<p>"Watch out, Petey."</p>
<p>"M-m-m-m."</p>
<p>"Petey, get out of the dust."</p>
<p>"Lookie. Haw, lookie. Here we are. The whole family. I got you in</p>
<p>this time--haw, lookie!"</p>
<p>There they were. The Meyerbogens as Petey had drawn them, only there</p>
<p>was something that made your heart catch on its beat.</p>
<p>[Illustration: The Meyerbogens]</p>
<p>"Why Petey, that's me, on the end. Why Petey----"</p>
<p>After he had gone like a streak through the door with his bread and</p>
<p>his apple sauce, she hung it back on the wall. Carefully. The</p>
<p>Meyerbogens.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Chimmie had to be dressed and walked up and down the room without his</p>
<p>braces and drilled not to curve out his leg. He cried because that</p>
<p>hurt, and after she had helped him up and down for a cruel twenty</p>
<p>minutes, he fell asleep. Then there was the sink drain pipe to be</p>
<p>poked out. Essie was such a little girl and of course she had let</p>
<p>the grease clog it up. Squnch. Ugh. It was not so bad if you</p>
<p>turned your head....</p>
<p>Meyerbogen was coming up the stairs. You could tell by the little</p>
<p>vibrations. They ran up the wall. The dishes shook. He carried a</p>
<p>tray of cinnamon buns. You could almost hear their soft hot breath</p>
<p>and get the whiff of the currants.</p>
<p>"Bertha, is dot you?"</p>
<p>"Yah...."</p>
<p>"Dot's good," he said, and went into the shop with the tray of hot</p>
<p>buns.</p>
<p>The day began to slant. There were potatoes to be dug. The screen</p>
<p>snapped as she went out with the dish pan, and the red calico curtain</p>
<p>swung. The clayey earth gave forth grudgingly and showed up hard and</p>
<p>yellow through the green. But the peas ran up the sticks gayly and</p>
<p>there was an arbor that was all spangled with tiny green grapes that</p>
<p>were no bigger than buckshot. Presently they would swell and purple</p>
<p>and soften. The way to press wine out of grapes was with the feet.</p>
<p>The bare, white toes.</p>
<p>Bertha's toes were hurting in her bluchers. The warm clay came</p>
<p>burning through to them, making them climb and wriggle. It was easy</p>
<p>to kick off the shoes and slide down the stockings. The soft, naked</p>
<p>earth. Its warmth ran up her legs in a lightning of gooseflesh. Her</p>
<p>toes bit down. White spatulate beauties, she could lift up little</p>
<p>dredges of clean dirt with them.</p>
<p>To be bled free of the torments of the ecstasies. To sit there in</p>
<p>the wide, westering light with the flat, eager faces of the toes down</p>
<p>tasting earth, the good earth, peasantly. Breathers. Suckers in of</p>
<p>the little vibratory messages.</p>
<p>Gladnesses here with dimension. The treble shrilling of the</p>
<p>children. Pretty leafage of peas up a stick. Clank. Clank.</p>
<p>Chimmie must be awake. Meyerbogen disappearing around the house with</p>
<p>a sack of flour on his back. The tawny smell of the bread.</p>

<p>License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all</p>

<p>1.F.</p>
<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable</p>
<p>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread</p>
<p>works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may</p>
<p>contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate</p>
<p>or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other</p>

<p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all</p>
<p>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal</p>

<p>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can</p>
<p>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a</p>
<p>written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you</p>
<p>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium</p>
<p>with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you</p>
<p>with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in</p>
<p>lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person</p>
<p>or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second</p>

<p>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of</p>
<p>damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement</p>
<p>violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the</p>
<p>agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or</p>
<p>limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or</p>
<p>unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the</p>
<p>remaining provisions.</p>
<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the</p>
<p>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone</p>
<p>providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in</p>
<p>accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the</p>
<p>production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,</p>
<p>including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of</p>
<p>the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this</p>
<p>or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or</p>
<p>additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any</p>
<p>Defect you cause.</p>
<p>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of</p>
<p>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of</p>
<p>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It</p>
<p>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations</p>
<p>from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the</p>
<p>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s</p>
<p>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will</p>
<p>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure</p>
<p>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future</p>
<p>generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>
<p>Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see</p>
<p>Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p>501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the</p>
<p>state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal</p>
<p>Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification</p>
<p>number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>

<p>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg</p>
<p>Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread</p>
<p>public support and donations to carry out its mission of</p>
<p>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</p>
<p>freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest</p>
<p>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations</p>
<p>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt</p>
<p>status with the IRS.</p>
<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</p>
<p>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</p>
<p>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</p>
<p>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</p>
<p>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations</p>
<p>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND</p>
<p>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state</p>
<p>visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</p>
<p>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition</p>
<p>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</p>
<p>approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make</p>
<p>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from</p>
<p>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation</p>
<p>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other</p>
<p>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To</p>
<p>donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project</p>
<p>Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be</p>
<p>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and</p>
<p>distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of</p>
<p>volunteer support.</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed</p>
<p>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in</p>
<p>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not</p>
<p>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper</p>
<p>edition.</p>
<p>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search</p>
<p>facility: www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,</p>
<p>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>
<p>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to</p>
<p>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
